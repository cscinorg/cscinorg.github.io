id=overview-and-purpose>Overview and Purpose</h4><p>All organisations recognise the need to protect their business functions, capabilities and processes from being disrupted or compromised. It requires the resilience to be built into the governance, business, technology and physical levels. Organisations use mechanisms like information security management systems (ISMS), incident response (IR), business continuity management systems (BCMS) and cyber crisis management plans (CCMP) to implement and manage the required resilience.</p><p>Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a generic term to describe the practice of protecting an organisation&rsquo;s business functions from disruptions and compromise, and to ensure compliance to laws and regulation. Critical sector entities with notified CII/ Protected Systems are mandated under IT (NCIIPC) Rules, 2018, to setup and operate an ISMS in their organisations.</p><p>All the business functions and processes run on an underlying <a href=/docs/glossary/terms/index.html#glossary_information_infrastructure>information infrastructure</a>. An ISMS can assure the resilience of an organisation&rsquo;s information infrastructure.</p><p>Organisations have an option to design, implement and operate their own custom-built ISMS. However, most organisations implement their ISMS based on published standards like IS/ISO/IEC 27001 or QCI CSMS Level 1. The latter option gives them the benefit of independent third-party certification by an accredited Certification Body (CB).</p><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
Tip</summary><div class=box-content><p>It is advisable for an organisation to start its ISMS journey with a custom-designed, standards-agnostic ISMS. This approach will trigger a deep application of mind on the governance, business and technical objectives and the desired outcomes from the ISMS without being constrained by any specific framework. If required, Section 4 of ISO 27003 can be used for basic guidance and direction. Once the standards-agnostic ISMS design is accepted by the governing body and the top management, the ISMS implementation team can work on using an appropriate standard for implementation.</p></div></details><p>Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) design, implementation and operation refers to the approach that organisations must adopt to protect their IT, OT and IIoT information infrastructure and keep them resilient against cyberattacks. The practice involves identifying risks to the information infrastructure of the organisation, designing policies and controls to mitigate and manage these risks, and implementing the same within the organisation.</p><p>A crucial part of this practice is about regular reviews and updates to keep up with evolving security threats. Consistent review and improvement of an organisation&rsquo;s ISMS practice not only secures the information infrastructure but also supports the organisations&rsquo; regulatory compliance and business continuity.</p><h4 id=isms-governance>ISMS Governance</h4><p>Governing bodies and top management of entities must direct the ISMS to be based on organisational reqirements and have an entity-wide perspective. They have the responsibility to evaluate the requirement of one or more ISMSs to support the information security objectives of the entity. Section 5 of ISO 27003 provides guidance for leadership functions. Section 6 of ISO 27003 and ISO 27005 provide guidance for risk related functions. Section 7 of ISO 27003 provides guidance on providing resources for implementation and operation of ISMS.</p><p>The governing body should undertake the following with due diligence for the success of ISMS:</p><ul><li><p>Mandatorily define and document an enterprise-level context for ISMS in their organisations.</p></li><li><p>Approve the creation of ISMS.</p></li><li><p>Mandatorily define and document an enterprise-level ISMS objective and policy. It should provide directions to each ISMS implementation in the organisation to align it with the enterprise context.</p></li><li><p>All policy and regulatory directions received from and national nodal bodies and the regulators should be incorporated into the enterprise-level ISMS policy. This will help auditors assess whether all the policies have been incorporated.</p></li><li><p>Take decisions on acceptable levels of residual risk or appropriate risk treatments.</p></li><li><p>Provide each ISMS with communication channels and authority to inform interested parties and all persons in the scope of that ISMS.</p></li></ul><p>Plans to obtain ISMS certifications must be formulated at the enterprise level. Obtaining certifications for individual sites, without having an entity-wide plan will be inefficient and ineffective because the individual ISMSs would not be aligned with the entity’s information security objectives, policies and processes and risk management.</p><p>The governing bodies and top management of entities must also monitor the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS during the operational stage to keep it aligned with the organisation&rsquo;s objectives.</p><h4 id=conformance-to-standards>Conformance to Standards</h4><p>ISMS based on ISO 27001:2022 or NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme offer significant benefits in terms of documentation and guidance. The ISO 27000 series documents provide comprehensive information for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving an ISMS. These documents can also be used for establishing an ISMS even when an organisation does not want the ISO certification.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>

The ISMS design and implementation team must understand the business functions and processes of the organisation and their interdependencies.</li><li><strong>Policy Development</strong>: Design comprehensive security policies that address the protection of information assets against various threats and establish security objectives.</li><li><strong>Roles Definition</strong>: Assign clear information security roles and responsibilities, ensuring accountability and proper oversight of the ISMS initiatives.</li><li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Find, assess, and handle risks according to the set standards.</li><li><strong>Control Selection</strong>: Choose appropriate security controls from the relevant frameworks to mitigate identified risks.</li><li><strong>Control Implementation</strong>: Deploy security measures and practices in alignment with the established ISMS policy framework, supporting the organisation&rsquo;s security strategy.</li><li><strong>Automation</strong>: Evaluate and select software applications and platforms for operating and managing the ISMS processes (documentation, risk, SoA mapping, evidence collection, compliance tracking etc).</li><li><strong>Employee Training and Awareness:</strong> Combine regular security awareness programs with skill enhancement training to educate employees about ISMS policies and improve their ability to contribute to the organisation&rsquo;s security.</li><li><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: Oversee the ongoing effectiveness of the ISMS and security controls, adapting to new threats and organisational changes.</li><li><strong>Regular Audits</strong>: Implement a schedule of internal and external audits to ensure continuous compliance with ISMS requirements and identify opportunities for improvement.</li><li><strong>Improvement Actions</strong>: Address non-conformities and areas of weakness identified during reviews and audits, closing gaps in the ISMS where necessary.</li></ul><h4 id=isms-implementation>ISMS Implementation</h4><p>Each ISMS must implement controls for information security risk treatment in accordance with the policies approved by the governing board / top management of the CSE. ISO 27003 provides explanation and guidance for implementing all requirements of ISO 27001.</p><p>Generic steps for implementing ISMS based on ISO 27001:2022 or NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme are given below:</p><ol><li>Set the scope of ISMS by defining what parts of the organisation’s information systems are intended to be protected. The scope typically includes the organisation’s business processes and locations that will be covered under ISMS.</li><li>Establish and publish a top-level Information Security policy for the organisation. This will be further supported by subordinate policies.</li><li>Set the Risk Assessment context as per the requirements stated in Clause 4 to Clause 10 of ISO 27001:2022. Use ISO 27005 and various other guidelines for risk assessment.</li><li>Identify and evaluate risk as per Clause 6 and Clause 8 of ISO 27001:2022.</li><li>Establish a Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC) for the organisation, which should be approved by the top management of the organisation (Board or Board equivalent). The RAC will then be used as the basis for risk management (assessment, evaluation, and treatment).</li><li>Set the risk acceptance threshold, based on the context of the organisation and the expectations of internal and external interested parties.</li><li>Formulate the risk treatment plan in respect of the RAC by selecting appropriate controls from &ldquo;Annex A of ISO 27001:2022&rdquo;. Add supplementary and technical controls from external sources (e.g. IS Series, MHA, NCIIPC, CERT-In, NSCS guidelines) and global good practices (e.g. PCI, CIS, Cloud Security Alliance) if they are considered necessary or suitable in the business context of the organisation. Use ISO 27002:2022 as a working guideline for meeting the requirements of ISO 27001:2022.</li><li>Document all the applicable controls along with their point of application in a Statement of Applicability (SoA) document. Any control, if excluded, should be justified in the SoA and the same should also comply with the risk acceptance criteria.</li><li>Implement the security controls given in the SoA on the information infrastructure. Typically, two-tier control deployment, viz primary control and supervisory control is adopted to mitigate the critical risks.</li><li>Carry out an audit or inspection of the information infrastructure through CERT-In empanelled auditors, covering both process and technical deployment of controls, as per the guidelines issued by CERT-In and NSCS.</li><li>Test the effectiveness of implementation and operation of cyber security technical controls through the mechanism of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VA & PT)</li></ol><p>ISMS flowchart is pictorially represented below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-610baec922b8ad19cdd6dddcbcf3c65a class=lightbox-link><img alt="ISMS Flowchart" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/organisation/governance/isms/isms_flowchart.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

Reporting to the governing body and top management is essential to the success of ISMS.</p><p><strong>IS/ISO/IEC TS 27008:2019</strong> provides guidance on reviewing and assessing the implementation and operation of information security controls, including the technical assessment of information system controls, in compliance with an organisation&rsquo;s established information security requirements including technical compliance against assessment criteria based on the information security requirements established by the organisation.</p><p>Another critical aspect of ISMS operation is to measure the outcomes delivered by it. <strong>ISO/IEC 27004</strong> provides detailed guidelines for evaluating the information security performance and the effectiveness of an ISMS.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Clause 9.1 requires the organisation to evaluate the information security performance and the effectiveness of the ISMS. It requires the organisation to determine:</p><ul><li>what needs to be monitored and measured (systems, processes and activities).</li><li>the methods for monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation.</li><li>when the monitoring and measuring shall be performed.</li><li>who shall monitor and measure.</li><li>when the results from monitoring and measurement shall be analysed and evaluated.</li><li>who shall analyse and evaluate these results.</li></ul><p>The ISMS operation must generate output for various attributes of the implemented controls that can be used to measure the efficacy of the controls, such as:</p><ul><li>the degree to which a control reduces the likelihood of the occurrence of an event.</li><li>the degree to which a control reduces the consequence of an event.</li><li>the frequency of events that a control can cope with before failure.</li><li>how long after the occurrence of an event does it take for the control to detect that the event has occurred.</li></ul><p>Usually, data from systems and processes is generated continuously in the form of event logs, audit trails, as it is done, supporting measures can be collected more frequently than the analysis and reporting of such measures to individual interested parties. For example, while data on security incidents can be collected continually, reporting of such data to external interested parties should be based on specific requirements, such as severity (possibly requiring immediate notification as in the case of a reportable breach) or aggregated values (as might be the case for attempted intrusions which were detected and blocked).</p><p>ISO/IEC 27001:2022 also requires the organisation to retain appropriate documented information as evidence of the monitoring and measurement results.</p><h5 id=metrics>Metrics</h5><p>Some of the proposed metrics are listed below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Key Performance Indicators</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of Security Incidents</td><td>Count of unwanted events that could endanger the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information.</td></tr><tr><td>Security Control Audit and Review Frequency</td><td>Measures the number of times security controls are reviewed and audited.</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Findings</td><td>The number of critical findings or unresolved issues from audits.</td></tr><tr><td>Delay in Scheduled Audits</td><td>Measures the percentage of scheduled audits and reviews that are not completed within their planned timeframes.</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Non-Compliance Issues</td><td>Track the number of identified non-compliance issues during the audit with legal and regulatory requirements</td></tr><tr><td>Effectiveness of Security Controls</td><td>Tracks the percentage of risks successfully prevented, detected, and mitigated.

There are many software platforms that can monitor the ISMS activities and generate reports for various levels of management. For example, human and machine-readable formats such as the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) are useful for automated management of ISMS controls. The software platforms also provide a record of ISMS activities that the audit teams can use as evidence.</p><p>Periodic inspection and audit of ISMS of CSEs is a time-consuming activity. The regulators and national bodies can also create platforms and processes for machine-processing of ISMS data from the CSEs, which will also help in sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis of audit compliance and non-compliance issues, audit effectiveness, grading of auditors etc.</p><h4 id=isms-practice-owners>ISMS Practice Owners</h4><p>A sample matrix of responsibilities is given below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Primary Ownership</th><th>Collaborative Role</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Establish and review the ISMS strategy.</td><td>ISSC</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr><tr><td>Oversee the development of ISMS policies and procedures.</td><td>CISO</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr><tr><td>Maintain the ISMS documentation and control mechanisms.</td><td>Information Security Team</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Ensure ISMS compliance with legal and regulatory standards.</td><td>GRC Team</td><td>Legal Team</td></tr><tr><td>Implement controls, standards and guidelines emanating from the ISMS implementation and design programme.</td><td>IT/OT Ops Team</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Conduct ISMS awareness and training programs.</td><td>HR Team</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr><tr><td>Monitor and report on ISMS performance using KPIs/KRIs.</td><td>GRC Team</td><td>IT/OT Ops Team</td></tr><tr><td>Manage ISMS auditing and continual improvement.</td><td>Internal/External Audit Team</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=nciipc-guidelines>NCIIPC Guidelines</h4><details open class="box cstyle notices important"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-bolt"></i>

The ISMS would specifically help the regulators to:</p><ul><li><p>Control the collection, processing, distribution, and retention, of sensitive information to be processed by them for effective regulation in the sector.</p></li><li><p>Understand the requirements of the ISMS established and audit the regulated entities on adherence to the requirements.</p></li><li><p>Issue sector-specific requirements, guidelines, checklists, to address the variations and constraints relevant to the local processing requirements.</p></li><li><p>Adopt audit tools and analysis engines, designed to standard requirements, for evaluation of the information security performance in the regulated entities.</p></li></ul><h4 id=isms-for-agencies-directing-cses>ISMS for Agencies directing CSEs</h4><p>Agencies directing and controlling the operations in the critical sector have a responsibility to lead the way.  The controlling agency typically review the functioning of the CSEs and, if policies exist that hinder the achievement of business objectives, these policies are identified and reported for improvement. Such agencies will therefore have sensitive data of the critical sectors. It is therefore recommended that the agencies also implement an ISMS to protect the information being processed at various levels within the agencies. Establishment of an ISMS will help the agencies to:</p><ul><li><p>Control the collection, processing, distribution, and retention, of sensitive information to be processed by them for effective governance in the sector.</p></li><li><p>Understand the requirements of the ISMS established, and issue relevant directions to the controlled entities, and supply-chain, on adherence to the requirements.</p></li><li><p>Establish a centrally managed framework to identify, analyse, evaluate, and treat the information security risks prevalent in the sector.</p></li><li><p>Get trust, recognition, and support from other stakeholders for information security governance in the sector.</p></li><li><p>Respond to emerging information security threats and trends by centrally managing the information security incidents in the sector.</p></li><li><p>Easily migrate to any upgrades and improvements in information security governance, based on international and industry best practices.</p></li></ul><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 22 Sep 2025</footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1758638377 defer></script><script src=/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1758638377 defer></script><script src=/js/theme.js?1758638377 defer></script></body></html>
