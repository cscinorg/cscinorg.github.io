class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=internal-context>Internal Context</h1><h3 id=operational_structure>Operational Structure</h3><h4 id=business-units>Business Units</h4><p>In the modern business and operational context, information technology has become a key business enabler. It is frequently the case that business units, also called line units, generate their own business requirements, consume external IT services, or get systems dedicated to their own units.</p><h4 id=departments>Departments</h4><p>Departments, also called staff units, perform staff functions to support the entity’s mission. In the context of IT and Information Security, most staff functions are performed through multiple departments with complex interdependencies. Some of the departments involved in a typical CSE for smooth delivery of these functions are:</p><ul><li><p>Administration department manages personnel and physical security.</p></li><li><p>Finance department manages the procurement.</p></li><li><p>Workforce (HR) department ensures that people have the right competencies and critical positions are always staffed by candidates with the right mix of skills and experience.</p></li><li><p>Legal and Corporate Governance department manages legal and regulatory compliance.</p></li><li><p>Internal Audit department provides an independent view of compliance of processes and people.</p></li><li><p>Technical functions related to IT are carried out by the IT Department </p></li><li><p>Information Security related functions are carried out by the Information Security Department.</p></li></ul><p>It is also well-established that Information technology is a key enabler for non-IT staff functions. The functional requirements of various departments are typically enabled through IT. The IT department is usually responsible for the design, development and/ or procurement, implementation and deployment, operation and management of the IT infrastructure, operations, and support. The departments themselves focus on the usage side of IT, covering the users, applications, and data.</p><p>Further, the Information Security Department usually works closely with the IT and the Legal and Corporate Governance Departments as part of its responsibility and accountability towards the governance, risk, policies, compliance, and assessment of information security of the entity’s IT infrastructure.</p><h4 id=sites-and-locations>Sites and Locations</h4><p>Large enterprises are typically spread across multiple sites or geographical locations, typically referred to as remote or branch offices. Sectors such as Power and Energy have OT Sites in the form of substations and regional command and control centres. Enterprises with such geographically separated ICTs must ensure governance mechanisms and controls for the holistic cybersecurity of the entity.</p><h3 id=organisational_structure>Organisational Structure</h3><h4 id=board-of-directors>Board of Directors</h4><p>The Board of Directors of CSEs is ultimately accountable for cybersecurity in the organisation and its responsibilities would include:</p><ul><li><p>approving strategic goals, business objectives, and policies related to IT, Business Continuity, Information Security, Cyber Security, and Cyber Crisis Management, </p></li><li><p>approving the cyber risk appetite as part of the overall risk appetite,</p></li><li><p>approving and overseeing the cybersecurity programme, strategy, and policy to manage cyber risks,</p></li><li><p>ensuring the implementation of the cybersecurity program,</p></li><li><p>being aware of and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory obligations related to cyber security risks,</p></li><li><p>supporting the culture of awareness of cybersecurity in the organisation,</p></li><li><p>allocating adequate budget and resources for fulfilling cybersecurity requirements.</p></li></ul><p>The Board of Directors of the CSEs should set up appropriate board level and other high-level empowered committees for the purpose of Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security to support both strategic and operational goals while addressing the unique risk and compliance requirements in these areas. The governance structures should be kept in mind while framing these committees. Board should have independent director with substantial IT expertise in managing / guiding information technology initiatives. Further technically competent members should be there in the Committees formed. </p><p>In case, any CSE doesn’t have a Board of Directors, then it would be the responsibility of the top management or executive leadership to set up appropriate high-level empowered committees for the purpose of Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security and ensure their effective functioning.</p><p>CSEs having “Protected System” are mandated to constitute an Information Security Steering Committee (ISSC) under the Chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer/ Managing Director/ Secretary of the organisation as per the Information Technology (Information Security Practices and Procedures for Protected System) Rules, 2018 notified vide Gazette Notification S.O. 2235(E) dated 22 May 2018.   </p><h4 id=top-level-management>Top-Level Management</h4><p>The top management of entities, led by the Chief Executive (Managing Director or CEO) is accountable to the governing body (or Board) with respect to the effective and efficient use of Information, Communication and Operational Technologies and Information Security. Most entities usually have permanent leadership roles, with teams under them, that constitutes enterprise-level top management. Typical leadership roles in a CSE are Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Chief of Operations/ Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) and, if required by law, a Data Protection Officer (DPO).</p><p>Top-level management&rsquo;s responsibilities in CSEs will centre around strategic alignment, value delivery, risk management, resource optimization, and stakeholder engagement to leverage IT for competitive advantage and sustainable business performance.</p><p>The essential top-level management functions for Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) and Information Security Governance (EISG) are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Aligning IT and infosec goals and objectives with the overall business strategy and vision set by the Board of Directors</strong>. This involves</p><ul><li><p>setting objectives and initiatives in line with the overall business goals.</p></li><li><p>establishing governance structures by creating committees and steering groups to oversee the alignment between business, IT and cyber resilience.</p></li><li><p>establishing entity-wide policies and programs.</p></li><li><p>ensuring stakeholder involvement.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Providing leadership, direction and oversight for the IT and Infosec departments.</strong> This includes defining the IT operating models, planning, organising and implementing projects to achieve the desired business outcomes, budgeting, organisational structure, roles and responsibilities, and project management oversight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resource Management</strong> - This entails ensuring optimal allocation and utilization of IT and infosec resources (e.g., personnel, technology, budgets), capacity planning, developing strategies for internal and external sourcing of IT and infosec services and solutions, exercising oversight on contracts with third-party service providers, outsourcing of work to Managed Service Providers (MSP), etc. Adequate resources should be designated specifically for cybersecurity, separate from those allocated for general IT needs. Allocation of such resources may widely vary based on the business objective and risk management of each CSE. However, based on global best practice, it is recommended that at least 10% of the total IT budget should be allocated to cybersecurity. This should progressively increase as per the cybersecurity risks faced by the entity. Such allocation should be mentioned under a separate budget head for monitoring by the Board of Directors, Governing Body</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk Management</strong> - This involves</p><ul><li><p>establishing a risk management framework that identifies, assesses and mitigates risks associated with the use of technology, and ensures compliance with the relevant laws, regulations, and policies.</p></li><li><p>analysing and managing the business impact of degradation, failure and non-availability of IT, OT and IIoT systems, and safety of operational technologies (OT).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring and measuring IT performance and value delivery</strong> - This involves</p><ul><li><p>maintaining oversight using management systems for all IT, OT and Information Security aspects that can adversely affect the organisation.</p></li><li><p>establishing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) for IT and infosec services and activities.</p></li><li><p>using performance data to drive continuous improvement in services and processes.</p></li><li><p>benchmarking to compare IT and infosec performance against industry standards and best practices.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Fostering effective communication, collaboration and partnership between business and IT stakeholders.</strong> Communicate regularly within and outside the entity to ensure coherence. This is especially important during crisis management related to high-impact IT and cybersecurity incidents.</p></li></ul><p>The Enterprise Information Security Governance (EISG) functions are usually led by the CRO or the Enterprise CISO, who is responsible for the implementation of enterprise-wide information security policies, and exercising information security-related oversight on the business groups and business units of the enterprise.</p><p>A CISO should have knowledge and experience of information security governance, risk and compliance management, ISMS and related issues. The CISO&rsquo;s responsibilities typically includes cyber resilience and cybersecurity planning, development and rollout of ISMS, coordinating the cyber security related issues within the organisation and with relevant external agencies. The CISO must be capable of performing the duties as per “Roles and Responsibilities of CISOs” as defined by NCIIPC, CERT-In and Regulators.</p><p>CSEs must clearly define the roles, responsibilties and teams for governance of enterprise IT and information security, as appropriate to their organisational structures. The leadership and teams must be given the required authority and resources to carry out their functions and held accountable for the required outcomes. A key factor for success is the ability of the leaders, their teams, business units and departments to work collaboratively to address the shared concerns of all stakeholders. Adequate thought must be given to behavioural aspects and conflict resolution mechanisms while assigning responsibilities to leaders and teams. Further, each team must have a proper mix of expertise and experience and should use technology to carry out the functions effectively.</p><h4 id=committees>Committees</h4><p>Entities usually have different formal and semi-formal structures to support the governing body and the top management in their IT and information security governance functions. These structures are in the form of committees, groups, task forces etc, and typically carry out evaluation, monitoring, and oversight functions to support the governing body and the top management.</p><p>Many Sectoral Regulators have prescribed the frameworks for the Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security for their regulated entities. The governance frameworks and governance related guidance of the important regulators of the country emphasise the need to have a good governance framework for enterprise IT and Information Security of entities using ICT for achieving their business mission and objectives.</p><h4 id=information-security-divisiondepartment-isd>Information Security Division/Department (ISD)</h4><p>The ISD of an entity is responsible for planning, implementing and continually improving the technology-driven capabilities, processes, and workforce to achieve cybersecurity.</p><p>Each business group or unit in the CSE may have its own ISO (Information Security Officer) and a team under him who may hierarchically report to the CISO. Together, they constitute the entity’s Information Security Division/Department with appropriate resources and manpower based on the size and business of the CSE.</p><h4 id=technology-strategy-and-perspective-planning>Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning</h4><p>All modern enterprises use technology to carry out their business functions. A good practice followed by many organisations is to have a Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning (TS&amp;PP) programme for planning, implementing and continually improving the technology-driven capabilities, processes, and workforce.</p><p>The technologies and processes are typically deployed through individual projects that are conceived, designed, and implemented by different business units and departments. In many cases, this leads to duplication or inadequate optimisation of enterprise resources, operations, and workforce utilisation.</p><p>The use of IT, OT and Information Security should therefore be evaluated, directed, and monitored from an entity-wide perspective that enables the governing bodies and top management to holistically evaluate the achievement of mission and business objectives. This will ensure that the individual IT, OT and IS projects of different business units and departments are aligned with the enterprise’s strategic IT and Information Security objectives and compliant with all enterprise policies and processes. Further, it helps in the optimisation of investments, IT and cybersecurity workforce competency development, exploitation of the latest technologies and practices, continuous improvement of cybersecurity maturity etc. </p><p>Organisations will benefit from having an entity-wide TS&amp;PP programme that provides enterprise-wide strategic direction and decisions on the use of IT, OT, and information security. The CTO, CIO, Heads of OT and CISO should be a part of Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning committee. Typically the committee should</p><ul><li><p>evaluate the objectives and expected outcomes of different projects within the overall technology adoption roadmap of the organisation.</p></li><li><p>synergise activities and investments across multiple projects.</p></li><li><p>provide oversight and guidance to individual project management teams.</p></li><li><p>oversee the cyber resilience aspects.</p></li></ul><h4 id=performance-and-effectiveness-monitoring>Performance and Effectiveness Monitoring</h4><p>Governing bodies and top management should have a well-defined mechanism for monitoring and measurement of IT, OT and Information Security performance and effectiveness of management systems and processes at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. The monitoring and measurement mechanism should cover all processes, both automated and manual, with the objective of providing actionable evidence to take preventive and corrective actions at each level.</p><p>Metrics are tools designed to enhance the performance and accountability through collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant performance related data. Metrics in information security track the achievement of set goals and objectives by measuring the degree to which security measures are applied, as well as assessing the controls&rsquo; efficiency and efficacy, evaluating the sufficiency of security measures, and pinpointing potential areas for improvement. Entities should develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for evaluation of their IT and Information Security programmes and periodically evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of their IT and Information Security Governance programmes by measuring the defined KPIs.</p><p>Organizations will benefit significantly from having a Performance and Effectiveness Monitoring (P&amp;EM) programme to assist the governing bodies and top management in their function of enterprise-wide monitoring and measurement of IT, OT and infosec performance and effectiveness. The Governance, Risk and Compliance team should work with the business units, IT, OT and Infosec Heads and other stakeholders to develop KPIs that monitor and measure vital aspects of IT, OT and Information Security processes, people and technologies. The KPIs should address the concerns of the governing body and top management.</p><p>CSEs should put in place a structured process of reporting cybersecurity related matters to the Board or the Board Level Committees through the CISO. Structured reporting should inter alia include, key cyber risks faced by the organisation, cyber security preparedness, cyber security postures, organisational initiatives to enhance the cyber security resilience, status of compliance with regulatory guidelines, reporting of cyber security events and incidents.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 20 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=governance>Governance</h1><p>Organisational governance is defined as &ldquo;a system by which an organisation makes and implements decisions in pursuit of its objectives.&rdquo; Organisational governance is achieved by a mix of standards, rules, processes, practices, and technology platforms that support maturity in governance.</p><p>In view of enhanced role of ICT for achieving the business mission and objectives, governance of IT and information security are considered as a subset or domain of organisational (entity) governance. Definitions of governance in specific context of IT and Information security are provided in ISO/IEC 26000, ISO/IEC 38500:2015<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> and ISO/IEC 27014:2020<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Governance of Enterprise IT</strong> (ISO/IEC 38500:2015) deals with resources required to acquire, process, store and disseminate information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enterprise Information Security Governance</strong> (ISO/IEC 27014:2020) deals with assurance of information confidentiality, integrity and availability and effective communication of the same with various external stakeholders.</p></li></ul><h4 id=governance-of-enterprise-it>Governance of Enterprise IT</h4><p> A model for good governance of IT shall assist those at the highest level of the entities to understand and fulfil their legal, regulatory and other obligations in respect of their entity’s use of IT.  Further it assists governing bodies to ensure that the use of IT contributes positively to the performance of the organisation. Governing bodies should exercise their authority to ensure that their organizations follow a well-defined and suitable model for governance of IT, based on global best practices, to ensure that the risks arising from the use of IT can be managed and opportunities can be exploited.</p><p>ISO/IEC 38500:2015 describes the principles and practices for good governance of IT and provides a baseline for each entity to develop their own model. The six core principles are:</p><ol><li><p>Establish responsibility.</p></li><li><p>Define strategy for IT to support business.</p></li><li><p>Make acquisitions as appropriate.</p></li><li><p>Ensure performance.</p></li><li><p>Ensure conformance.</p></li><li><p>Achieve appropriate human behaviour.</p></li></ol><p>Further, three main practices through which the governing bodies can continuously evolve governance of IT are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Evaluate</strong> the current and future use of IT in the context of the business need.</p></li><li><p><strong>Direct</strong> preparation and implementation of strategies and policies to ensure that use of IT meets business objectives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitor</strong> performance against the strategies particularly regarding their business objectives and conformance to external obligations and internal work practices.</p></li></ol><h4 id=governance-of-information-security>Governance of Information Security</h4><p>Governance of information security ensure effective implementation of information security controls and provides the following assurance:</p><ul><li><p>Directives concerning information security will be followed.</p></li><li><p>The governing body will receive reliable and relevant reports about information security related activities.</p></li></ul><p>The framework for governance of information security will assist the governing body to make decisions concerning the strategic objectives for the organisation. It further provides information about information security that can affect these strategic objectives. It also ensures that information security strategy aligns with the overall objectives of the entity.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27014:2020 defines six objectives for information security governance that provide a baseline for overall direction and control by the governing bodies and the top management. The detailed description of each objective and process is given in the ISO document. The practical application of each objective within an entity is briefly described below:</p><h5 id=1-establish-integrated-comprehensive-entity-wide-information-security>1. Establish integrated comprehensive entity-wide information security</h5><p>Objective 1 calls for the establishment of an integrated comprehensive entity-wide information security framework. In practice, this would generally be addressed as under:</p><ul><li><p>Organizations should define and document an enterprise level context for their Information Security Management System (ISMS). Further, the context, scope, external elements etc. of each of their individual ISMS implementations (business-unit or site-based) should flow from and be fully aligned with the enterprise context.</p></li><li><p>Organizations should define and document an enterprise level ISMS objective and policy. The ISMS policies of each of the individual ISMS implementations should be aligned with the enterprise context.</p></li></ul><p>An enterprise level approach would provide the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Governing bodies and top management can evaluate, direct, and monitor that information security is consistent across the enterprise.</p></li><li><p>Regulators and national nodal agencies can validate that the policy directives and regulatory guidelines provided to the regulated and critical sector entities are incorporated into the enterprise level ISMS framework, which further gets applied uniformly into all the ISMS implementations in the entities.</p></li><li><p>Auditors can easily assess and verify whether all the mandated policies have been incorporated in each of the ISMSs audited by them.</p></li></ul><h5 id=2make-decisions-using-a-risk-based-approach>2. Make decisions using a risk-based approach</h5><p>Objective 2 calls for using a risk-based approach for decisions. A risk-based approach is recognised world-wide as an effective mechanism for inter-se prioritisation of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Investment in protection functions that includes business continuity.</p></li><li><p>Allocation and use of resources.</p></li><li><p>Work related to tracking and monitoring functions.</p></li><li><p>Incident response and crisis management activities.</p></li></ul><p>In general, risk is a function of impact and likelihood. However, entities may decide that the potential impact of some of the disruptions are so devastating that they have the highest risk even if their likelihood is very low. In all other cases, risk reflects the organisation’s ability to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfil its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals.  </p><p>Regulated and critical sector entities would benefit from using the ISO, IEC, NIST and other well-known standards to design, develop and implement risk management system within their organisations. A risk-based approach helps entities correctly identify all the controls that are applicable in their ISMSs.  An enterprise level approach to risk management would provide the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Governing bodies and top management can evaluate the information security risks with the use of IT to achieve business objectives and further incorporate them into the enterprise level ISMS framework. This will help them direct and monitor the individual ISMSs effectively.</p></li><li><p>Regulators and national nodal agencies can validate that all the additional controls prescribed by them are consolidated into the enterprise level ISMS framework, which further gets applied uniformly into all the ISMS implementations in the entities.</p></li><li><p>Cybersecurity auditors can use the comprehensively defined Statement of Applicability (SoA) to verify that all risks have been considered for their technical audit.</p></li></ul><h5 id=3set-the-direction-of-acquisition>3. Set the direction of acquisition</h5><p>Objective 3 calls for setting the direction of acquisition of IT, OT, and Information Security capabilities in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</p><p>The enterprise level risk assessment carried out as part of Objective 2 will help in the prioritisation of investments and allocation of resources. The Information Security Steering Committees (ISSC) of critical sector entities can provide right guidance to the top management when there is a common understanding of risk.</p><h5 id=4ensure-conformance-with-internal-and-external-requirements>4. Ensure conformance with internal and external requirements.</h5><p>Objective 4 calls for ensuring conformance with internal and external requirements.</p><p>One of the objectives of regulators and national bodies is to standardise information security management and its audit across various entities, particularly the critical sector entities. A common approach and methodology of audit of IT Security can be achieved through the guidelines given in various national / international standards.</p><p>Entities should evaluate and adopt an internationally accepted methodology for audit of the implemented IT and Information Security Management System at agreed frequency and scope (this frequency and scope should be compliant with the minimum baseline promulgated vide various rules and regulations). The audit scope, audit objective, audit criteria and the competency of the auditors should be such that it provides adequate assurance to the stakeholders on the objectivity and impartiality of the results. The results of the audit are to be reviewed at an appropriate level in the entity / controller / regulator. The causal analysis and corrective action plan for any non-conformities observed in the audit are also to be reviewed and tracked for acceptable closure.</p><h5 id=5foster-a-security-positive-culture>5. Foster a security-positive culture</h5><p>Objective 5 calls for fostering a security-positive culture, which is largely a people-driven activity. This requires the top management to focus on building a positive information security culture within the entity through security education, training and awareness programs and integrating the information security responsibilities into the roles of employees and managers.</p><h5 id=6ensure-the-security-performance-meets-current-and-future-requirements-of-the-entity>6. Ensure the security performance meets current and future requirements of the entity</h5><p>Objective 6 calls for ensuring that the security performance meets current and future requirements of the entity.</p><p>A data-driven analytical approach for security performance monitoring and measurement would be highly beneficial for entities. This approach requires entities to identify and use software applications and automation platforms for data acquisition, evidence collection and analysis of both IT and information security performance. The acquired measurement data would help the internal, external, and special audit teams to review and assess the information security processes and activities.</p><p>National nodal agencies can further evolve platforms and processes for machine-processing of data from different entities to carry out sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis of audit compliance, audit effectiveness and grading of auditors. </p><p>The governing bodies and the top management may apply following four main processes repetitively to achieve the above objectives:</p><ol><li><p>Evaluate</p></li><li><p>Direct</p></li><li><p>Monitor</p></li><li><p>Communicate</p></li></ol><h4 id=essential-top-level-management-governance-functions>Essential Top Level Management Governance Functions</h4><p>The key processes for governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security are depicted in the pictorial below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-c2ab9f5d7810d65b7b7012b64c7d1a45 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/organisation/governance/governance-of-IT-and-IS.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The focus of governance of IT is on managing resources to acquire, process, store and disseminate information (this may include OT and IIoT). This functionality is complemented by the governance of Information Security, which focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (including the safety of OT and IIoT).</p><p>The governing bodies and top management of all regulated and critical sector entities are accountable for the Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security. They have the responsibility to evaluate and direct the specific actions required to implement the principles within their organisations and monitor their efficacy. In short, Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security are board-level agendas.</p><p>Communication is an important Information Security governance process since it enables entities to be held accountable to interested parties. As part of this function, the critical sector entities must maintain continuous information flow with the national nodal agencies and the sectoral regulators. This communication is necessary for the national nodal agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of their risk management and information security management.  The entities are also required by law to report information security incidents to appropriate national nodal agencies and regulators, as applicable.</p><p>Assurance aspect is overseen by the sectoral regulators and the national nodal agencies bodies, who exercise their authority to audit the regulated and critical sector entities for compliance to law, regulation and directives issued by them.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that, while the authority for specific aspects of IT and Information Security may be delegated to managers within the organisations, the accountability for effective, efficient, and acceptable use of IT and Information Security within the entity and all its organizations remains with the governing body and top management in case of CSEs. This responsibility and accountability cannot be delegated.</p><p>The governance of enterprise IT and information security in the internal context (within the jurisdiction of the entity) is fairly straightforward. All entities typically implement their IT, OT and IS infrastructure to align with their business functions. The operational structure is usually in the form of business units, departments, sites/ branches, and locations. The organisational structure is closely aligned with the operational structure in the form of a governing body or board, top or executive management, senior, middle-level, and lower-level management.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:38500:ed-2:v1:en rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:38500:ed-2:v1:en</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27014:ed-2:v1:en rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27014:ed-2:v1:en</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 17 Sep 2025</footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Governance</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=information-security-management-system-isms>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h1><h3 id=isms-design-implementation-and-operation>ISMS Design, Implementation and Operation</h3><h4 id=overview-and-purpose>Overview and Purpose</h4><p>All organisations recognise the need to protect their business functions, capabilities and processes from being disrupted or compromised. It requires the resilience to be built into the governance, business, technology and physical levels. Organisations use mechanisms like information security management systems (ISMS), incident response (IR), business continuity management systems (BCMS) and cyber crisis management plans (CCMP) to implement and manage the required resilience.</p><p>Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a generic term to describe the practice of protecting an organisation&rsquo;s business functions from disruptions and compromise, and to ensure compliance to laws and regulation. Critical sector entities with notified CII/ Protected Systems are mandated under IT (NCIIPC) Rules, 2018, to setup and operate an ISMS in their organisations.</p><p>All the business functions and processes run on an underlying <a href=/docs/glossary/terms/index.html#glossary_information_infrastructure>information infrastructure</a>. An ISMS can assure the resilience of an organisation&rsquo;s information infrastructure.</p><p>Organisations have an option to design, implement and operate their own custom-built ISMS. However, most organisations implement their ISMS based on published standards like IS/ISO/IEC 27001 or QCI CSMS Level 1. The latter option gives them the benefit of independent third-party certification by an accredited Certification Body (CB).</p><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
Tip</summary><div class=box-content><p>It is advisable for an organisation to start its ISMS journey with a custom-designed, standards-agnostic ISMS. This approach will trigger a deep application of mind on the governance, business and technical objectives and the desired outcomes from the ISMS without being constrained by any specific framework. If required, Section 4 of ISO 27003 can be used for basic guidance and direction. Once the standards-agnostic ISMS design is accepted by the governing body and the top management, the ISMS implementation team can work on using an appropriate standard for implementation.</p></div></details><p>Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) design, implementation and operation refers to the approach that organisations must adopt to protect their IT, OT and IIoT information infrastructure and keep them resilient against cyberattacks. The practice involves identifying risks to the information infrastructure of the organisation, designing policies and controls to mitigate and manage these risks, and implementing the same within the organisation.</p><p>A crucial part of this practice is about regular reviews and updates to keep up with evolving security threats. Consistent review and improvement of an organisation&rsquo;s ISMS practice not only secures the information infrastructure but also supports the organisations&rsquo; regulatory compliance and business continuity.</p><h4 id=isms-governance>ISMS Governance</h4><p>Governing bodies and top management of entities must direct the ISMS to be based on organisational reqirements and have an entity-wide perspective. They have the responsibility to evaluate the requirement of one or more ISMSs to support the information security objectives of the entity. Section 5 of ISO 27003 provides guidance for leadership functions. Section 6 of ISO 27003 and ISO 27005 provide guidance for risk related functions. Section 7 of ISO 27003 provides guidance on providing resources for implementation and operation of ISMS.</p><p>The governing body should undertake the following with due diligence for the success of ISMS:</p><ul><li><p>Mandatorily define and document an enterprise-level context for ISMS in their organisations.</p></li><li><p>Approve the creation of ISMS.</p></li><li><p>Mandatorily define and document an enterprise-level ISMS objective and policy. It should provide directions to each ISMS implementation in the organisation to align it with the enterprise context.</p></li><li><p>All policy and regulatory directions received from and national nodal bodies and the regulators should be incorporated into the enterprise-level ISMS policy. This will help auditors assess whether all the policies have been incorporated.</p></li><li><p>Take decisions on acceptable levels of residual risk or appropriate risk treatments.</p></li><li><p>Provide each ISMS with communication channels and authority to inform interested parties and all persons in the scope of that ISMS.</p></li></ul><p>Plans to obtain ISMS certifications must be formulated at the enterprise level. Obtaining certifications for individual sites, without having an entity-wide plan will be inefficient and ineffective because the individual ISMSs would not be aligned with the entity’s information security objectives, policies and processes and risk management.</p><p>The governing bodies and top management of entities must also monitor the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS during the operational stage to keep it aligned with the organisation&rsquo;s objectives.</p><h4 id=conformance-to-standards>Conformance to Standards</h4><p>ISMS based on ISO 27001:2022 or NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme offer significant benefits in terms of documentation and guidance.

The scope typically includes the organisation’s business processes and locations that will be covered under ISMS.</li><li>Establish and publish a top-level Information Security policy for the organisation. This will be further supported by subordinate policies.</li><li>Set the Risk Assessment context as per the requirements stated in Clause 4 to Clause 10 of ISO 27001:2022. Use ISO 27005 and various other guidelines for risk assessment.</li><li>Identify and evaluate risk as per Clause 6 and Clause 8 of ISO 27001:2022.</li><li>Establish a Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC) for the organisation, which should be approved by the top management of the organisation (Board or Board equivalent). The RAC will then be used as the basis for risk management (assessment, evaluation, and treatment).</li><li>Set the risk acceptance threshold, based on the context of the organisation and the expectations of internal and external interested parties.</li><li>Formulate the risk treatment plan in respect of the RAC by selecting appropriate controls from &ldquo;Annex A of ISO 27001:2022&rdquo;. Add supplementary and technical controls from external sources (e.g. IS Series, MHA, NCIIPC, CERT-In, NSCS guidelines) and global good practices (e.g. PCI, CIS, Cloud Security Alliance) if they are considered necessary or suitable in the business context of the organisation. Use ISO 27002:2022 as a working guideline for meeting the requirements of ISO 27001:2022.</li><li>Document all the applicable controls along with their point of application in a Statement of Applicability (SoA) document. Any control, if excluded, should be justified in the SoA and the same should also comply with the risk acceptance criteria.</li><li>Implement the security controls given in the SoA on the information infrastructure.

It requires the organisation to determine:</p><ul><li>what needs to be monitored and measured (systems, processes and activities).</li><li>the methods for monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation.</li><li>when the monitoring and measuring shall be performed.</li><li>who shall monitor and measure.</li><li>when the results from monitoring and measurement shall be analysed and evaluated.</li><li>who shall analyse and evaluate these results.</li></ul><p>The ISMS operation must generate output for various attributes of the implemented controls that can be used to measure the efficacy of the controls, such as:</p><ul><li>the degree to which a control reduces the likelihood of the occurrence of an event.</li><li>the degree to which a control reduces the consequence of an event.</li><li>the frequency of events that a control can cope with before failure.</li><li>how long after the occurrence of an event does it take for the control to detect that the event has occurred.</li></ul><p>Usually, data from systems and processes is generated continuously in the form of event logs, audit trails, as it is done, supporting measures can be collected more frequently than the analysis and reporting of such measures to individual interested parties. For example, while data on security incidents can be collected continually, reporting of such data to external interested parties should be based on specific requirements, such as severity (possibly requiring immediate notification as in the case of a reportable breach) or aggregated values (as might be the case for attempted intrusions which were detected and blocked).</p><p>ISO/IEC 27001:2022 also requires the organisation to retain appropriate documented information as evidence of the monitoring and measurement results.</p><h5 id=metrics>Metrics</h5><p>Some of the proposed metrics are listed below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Key Performance Indicators</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of Security Incidents</td><td>Count of unwanted events that could endanger the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information.</td></tr><tr><td>Security Control Audit and Review Frequency</td><td>Measures the number of times security controls are reviewed and audited.</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Findings</td><td>The number of critical findings or unresolved issues from audits.</td></tr><tr><td>Delay in Scheduled Audits</td><td>Measures the percentage of scheduled audits and reviews that are not completed within their planned timeframes.</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Non-Compliance Issues</td><td>Track the number of identified non-compliance issues during the audit with legal and regulatory requirements</td></tr><tr><td>Effectiveness of Security Controls</td><td>Tracks the percentage of risks successfully prevented, detected, and mitigated.

Typical job titles at each level are also mentioned, which are indicative of the associated job roles, tasks, and responsibilities.</p><ul><li><p>Governing board and top management level – Board of Directors, MD, CEO.</p></li><li><p>Senior management level – Vice Presidents, CFO, CRO, CHRO, CTO, CIO, CISO, CSO, Heads of Business Units, Divisions, and Departments.</p></li><li><p>Middle and lower management level – IT Project Managers, Technology Managers, IT Operations Managers, IT Security Managers, Cyber Defence, NOC, and SOC Team Leads, GRC Managers, Workforce Development Managers etc.</p></li><li><p>Individual Contributor level – Operators, Analysts, Administrators, Specialists, Engineers, Technicians, Architects, Developers, Testers, QA, Apprentices, Associates, Interns. Individual contributors may also include MSP/ MSSP personnel and contractors etc, working in the CSEs.</p></li></ul><p>The middle and lower management, as well as individual contributors, are accountable and responsible for day-to-day operational activities and tasks.</p><h3 id=workforce-competencies>Workforce Competencies</h3><p>The overall workforce in an organisation, having accountability and responsibility for cybersecurity, would typically comprise of a composite mix of employees, contracted/ hired resources, and external providers of products (OEMs/ ISVs) and services (OEM partners, System Integrators, consultants, other service providers). The essential competencies and focus of the composite workforce are summarised in the table below, along with the applicable knowledge, skills, expertise, and experience.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Workforce Level</strong></th><th><strong>Focus</strong></th><th><strong>Competencies</strong></th><th><strong>Knowledge & Skill Areas</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Governing board and top management</td><td>Business objectives, Information/ Cybersecurity</td><td>Business strategy, governance of use of IT, OT and Information security. Expertise in managing technology for a qualified IT Strategy Committee (ITSC), where established</td><td>Business Strategy, Risk, Finance, Technology, Workforce Development.

Given the size and complexity of IT, OT, IIoT and cybersecurity ecosystems, the CSEs and other organisations usually have a <strong>composite workforce</strong> which is a mix of own employees, contracted workforce, resources of SIs, OEMs, ISVs, Partners, consultants, MSPs, SaaS and other service providers, who work together to carry out the organisations’ activities and tasks. A must have practice for an outsourced workforce is to have senior and middle-level managers of the organisation oversee the outsourced work.</p><p>Cybersecurity practices and processes can map across multiple cybersecurity support functions due to the interconnected nature of cybersecurity operations, where different aspects of a process may support various functions simultaneously. Considering the interconnected nature of cybersecurity activities, entities should assign the primary ownership and support roles to the activities related to each practice/ process.</p><p>Primary ownership indicates the team or role with overall responsibility for executing a particular cybersecurity process or function. The primary team or role is accountable for the required outcomes and decision-making. The support (collaborative() role identifies the supporting teams or roles that contribute to the overall objectives of the practice or process. They may be required to provide necessary data, analysis, or assistance to ensure the process&rsquo;s success.</p><p>The top and senior management of CSEs may use well-known mechanisms like RACI matrix to outline the roles and responsibilities of individuals and teams. The primary owners must be clear about their responsibility and accountability while the collaborative teams and roles must know what support is expected from them.</p><p>It is essential that the top and senior management clearly communicate the overarching objectives of cybersecurity and how each team’s efforts contribute to them. Cyber resilience can be enhanced when there is a shared sense of purpose and reduced friction between teams that usually arises due to overlapping or conflicting purposes.</p><p>Organisations will accrue significant benefits if their workforce understands the end goal of the practices and processes, and how the activities and tasks help or harm the accomplishment of the goal. Training and enablement of the workforce should focus on this aspect so that the workforce has a clear understanding of their ownership and responsibility for achieving the objectives.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 17 Sep 2025</footer></article></section></div></main></div><script src=/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1758556808 defer></script><script src=/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1758556808 defer></script><script src=/js/theme.js?1758556808 defer></script></body></html>
