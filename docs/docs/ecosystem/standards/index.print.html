Cyber resiliency engineering intends to architect, design, develop, implement, maintain, and sustain the trustworthiness of systems with the capability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises that use or are enabled by cyber resources. From a risk management perspective, cyber resiliency is intended to help reduce the mission, business, organizational, enterprise, or sector risk of depending on cyber resources.</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><strong>NIST SP 800-53rev5</strong> The control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls). Controls are organized into 20 families and over 1000 controls.</td><td>Significant changes in SP 800-53rev5: a) Making the controls more outcome-based by removing the entity responsible for satisfying the control (i.e., information system, organization) from the control statement; b) Separating control selection processes from the controls, thereby allowing the controls to be used by different communities of interest; c) Removing control baselines and tailoring guidance from the publication and transferring the content to SP 800-53B; d) Clarifying the relationship between requirements and controls; e) Incorporating new, state-of-the-practice controls (e.g., controls to support cyber resiliency, support secure systems design, and strengthen security and privacy governance and accountability) based on the latest threat intelligence and cyber-attack data.</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><strong>NIST SP 800-53A</strong> Provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of controls.</td><td>a) Security and privacy control assessments are the principal vehicle used to verify that selected security and privacy controls are implemented and meet the stated goals and objectives.

Guidance based on IS, ISO, IEC, ITU-T standards provides the following advantages:</p><ul><li><p>These standards are maintained and regularly updated by an international panel of experts, which also has Indian participation.</p></li><li><p>The ISO standards can be easily extended to include any additional requirements, especially those that are defined under the Indian law and regulation, or available in global frameworks like NIST, CIS, CSA etc. </p></li><li><p>The standards provide a common baseline reference amongst all the stakeholders and lower the possibility of misunderstanding, especially in the</p><ul><li><p>definition and usage of various terms</p></li><li><p>governance, management, risk, compliance and audit frameworks</p></li><li><p>implementation and continual improvement approaches</p></li><li><p>standardisation of processes related to verification, validation, measurement and audit.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Entities can get their organisations certified against specific management standards. The entities can also procure and use the other guidance and technical standards to help them in maximising the effectiveness during implementation.</p></li><li><p>There will be synergy between the entities and their internal/ external experts, consultants, implementers and auditors, since everyone refers to the same set of standards. In practice, this is already being done with regard to popular standards such as ISO 9000, ISO 27000 and IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>The oversight mechanism of Government bodies, regulators and national nodal agencies is easily harmonised when all bodies adopt a commonly accepted set of standards.</p></li><li><p>There is already a large pool of consultants, implementers and auditors in India, who have the knowledge, expertise and experience in implementing and auditing entities based on these standards. Capacity building of this pool, both in terms of quantity of personnel and quality of expertise, can be taken up through various national and international forums. Both ISO and IEC invest in strengthening the skills of its members, both at the human and the organisational level, through extensive training and technical assistance programmes. The capacity building programmes of ISO and IEC may be explored further.</p></li><li><p>BIS, a member of ISO and IEC, has a mechanism in place for standardisation and supply of standards at reasonable prices within the Indian ecosystem. Similarly, Department of Telecom (DoT) represents India at the ITU-T and QCI is a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), a worldwide association of accreditation bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment. Through these organisations, the Indian Government and ecosystem can maximise the effectiveness of use of globally recognised standards and frameworks.</p></li><li><p>The ISO and IEC are exploring new ways to provide dynamic deliverables that adapt to the needs of users in a much more flexible way. Together, they are developing a common vision for Standards that are Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART)<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>,<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>. The SMART standards will be modular, machine readable, and eventually, machine interpretable and executable. The corresponding Indian Standards can hugely benefit from this initiative.</p></li></ul><p>All the stakeholders are therefore encouraged to develop their understanding of the core principles, approaches, methods and processes described in these base set of standards. The stakeholders could apply the guidance from the standards as under:</p><ul><li><p>Governance of IT and information security, based on ISO/IEC 38500, 27014, COBIT etc</p></li><li><p>Service Management System (SMS), based on IS/ISO/IEC 20000 family, ITIL .</p></li><li><p>Information Security Management System (ISMS), based on IS/ISO/IEC 27000 family and the NCIIPC-QCI Conformity Assessment Framework for Cybersecurity of CSEs.</p></li><li><p>ISO 27013 standard that assists organisations in implementing both ISO 27001 and ISO 20000-1 concurrently or in implementing one where another is already in place.</p></li><li><p>OT Security that are typically based on IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>Other standards related to IT asset management, audit etc.</p></li><li><p>Technology-level frameworks such as NIST, CIS, CSA, Secure Controls Framework (SCF), SOC-CMM etc.</p></li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html rel=external target=_blank>https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/smart rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:6><p><a href=https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart rel=external target=_blank>https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 15 Sep 2025</footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1758036164 defer></script><script src=/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1758036164 defer></script><script src=/js/theme.js?1758036164 defer></script></body></html>
