stakeholders to communicate their perspectives for common understanding. The terms and definitions are derived from various standards, applicable laws (e.g. The IT Act 2000), regulations and public sources. The source(s) of definitions of the terms are also provided, where available.</p><h4 id=basic-terms>Basic Terms</h4><h6 id=infosec_nist_crsc>Information Security (NIST CRSC)</h6><ul><li>the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</li></ul><h6 id=infosec_iso_270000_2018>Information Security (ISO 27000:2018)</h6><ul><li>preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.</li></ul><p>Note: In addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.</p><h6 id=cybersec_itaa_2008>Cyber Security (ITAA-2008)</h6><ul><li>protecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</li></ul><p>Note 1: The terms Information Security (IS) and Cyber Security (CS) are often used interchangeably, since there are only some minor distinctions between the two terms. Notes 2 to 5 below provide guidance for specific situations in which one term is more appropriate than the other.</p><p>Note 2: In general, the information security is used in the context of securing information that is held and managed in both digital and non-digital (paper-based) forms. Cybersecurity is used in the context of securing the cyber-ecosystem (IT, OT, and IIoT) from cyber-attacks.</p><p>Note 3: Data and information content encompasses i) content created, used and managed using office productivity tools, ii) content stored in databases and other electronic repositories, which may be located on-premises or on cloud, iii) content searched, accessed and shared using web, email and other technologies, iv) machine to machine exchange of content through information exchange standards and protocols (EDI, API, STIX/TAXII), and OT-specific communication protocols (Modbus, DNP3/ IEEE 1815-2012, IEC-60870, IEC 61850, IEC 61131, IEC 62351) and, v) archival content stored in online and offline backups.</p><p>Note 4: Data and information related activities encompass i) content creation, updation and deletion (CRUD activities), ii) data processing, iii) view, copy, scan, search and print, iv) content integrity and confidentiality protection using digital signatures and encryption, v) masking or redaction of sensitive content and reclassification of the masked/ redacted content, vi) content exchange and distribution through electronic media and communication channels, vii) short-term and long-term storage of content and, viii) secure disposal of content from all the electronic stores, as per the organisation policies.</p><p>Note 5: Most OT systems are process control systems. Typically, the input and output OT data of such systems have a short period of utility. Hence, confidentiality of such data exchanged through OT protocols, as well as intermittent data loss are minor concerns. As regards data integrity, the concern is more about the integrity of the process control systems that generate, consume and process the data using OT protocols. The most important concerns of such systems are the availability of the systems themselves, safety of the physical environment around the systems or influenced by them. In summary, focus of OT security is more about protecting critical processes (Safety, Availability, Integrity) and less about data loss (Confidentiality).</p><h6 id=cyberresiliency_nist_crsc>Cyber resiliency (NIST CRSC)</h6><ul><li>the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.</li></ul><p>Note: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting the digital infrastructure from unauthorised access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. Cyber resilience is an organisation’s capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber threats and disruptions. Both functions require a combination of technologies, practices and processes, policies and controls, peope and governance for delivering the required outcomes.</p><h4 id=governance-of-enterprise-it-and-information-security>Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security</h4><h5 id=adopted-from-isoiec-standards>Adopted from ISO/IEC Standards</h5><h6 id=accountable-iso-385002015>Accountable (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>answerable for actions, decisions and performance.</li></ul><h6 id=accountability-iso-385002015>Accountability (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>state of being accountable. Accountability relates to an allocated responsibility.

An entity can have multiple Organizations within itself or be identical to the organisation, as in smaller companies. The entity has governance authority over the organisation.</li></ul><h6 id=evaluate-iso-385002015>Evaluate (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>consider and make informed judgements. In the context of governance of IT, evaluate involves judgements about the internal and external, current and future circumstances and opportunities relating to the organisation&rsquo;s current and future use of IT.</li></ul><h6 id=executive-manager-iso-385002015>Executive manager (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>person who has authority delegated from the governing body for implementation of strategies and policies to fulfil the purpose of the organisation. Executive managers can include roles which report to the governing body or the head of the organisation or have overall accountability for major reporting function, for example Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), Heads of Government Organizations, Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), Chief Operating Officers (COOs), Chief Information Officers (CIs), and similar roles. In management standards, executive managers can be referred to as top management.</li></ul><h6 id=governance-iso-385002015>Governance (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>system of directing and controlling</li></ul><h6 id=governance-of-it-iso-385002015>Governance of IT (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>system by which the current and future use of IT is directed and controlled. Governance of IT is a component or a subset of organisational governance. The term governance of IT is equivalent to corporate governance of IT, enterprise governance of IT, and organisational governance of IT.</li></ul><p>Note: Typically, Enterprise IT Governance deals with resources required to acquire, process, store and disseminate information. Enterprise Information Security Governance deals with assurance of information confidentiality, integrity and availability and effective communication of the same with various external stakeholders.</p><h6 id=governing-body-iso-270142020>Governing body (ISO 27014:2020)</h6><ul><li>person or group of people who are accountable for the performance and conformance of the entity.</li></ul><h6 id=management-iso-385002015>Management (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>exercise of control and supervision within the authority and accountability established by governance.</li></ul><p>Note: The term management describes the coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation (ISO 9000:2015). It can include establishing policies and objectives, and processes to achieve the objectives. It is also used as a collective term for those with responsibility for controlling an organisation or parts of an organisation. The term managers is used to avoid confusion with management systems.</p><h6 id=managers-iso-385002015>Managers (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>group of people responsible for control and supervision of an organisation or parts of an organisation. Executive managers are a category of managers.</li></ul><h6 id=monitor-iso-385002015>Monitor (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>review as a basis for appropriate decisions and adjustments. Monitoring involves routinely obtaining information about progress against plans as well as the periodic examination of overall achievements against agreed strategies and outcomes to provide a basis for decision making and adjustments to plans. Monitoring includes reviewing compliance with relevant legislation, regulations, and organisational policies.</li></ul><h6 id=organisation-iso-270142020>Organisation (ISO 27014:2020)</h6><ul><li>The whole entity or part of an entity, which works under the governance authority of the entity.</li></ul><p>Note: ISO/IEC 27014:2020 provides the distinction between entity and organisation in the context of ISMS. By definition, the ISMS covers the whole of an organisation, which by itself may cover the whole of the entity or part of the entity. Typically the two terms defined in ISO 27014:2020 are applied to both the governance of IT and Information Security.</p><h6 id=organisational-governance-iso-385002015>Organisational governance (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>system by which Organisations are directed and controlled.</li></ul><h6 id=responsibility-iso-385002015>Responsibility (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>obligation to act and take decisions to achieve required outcomes</li></ul><h6 id=top-management-iso-270142020>Top management (ISO 27014:2020)</h6><ul><li>person or group of people who direct and control the organisation (as defined above) at the highest level. The top management of the organisation is accountable to the governing body of the entity and has the power to delegate authority and provide resources within the organisation.
