IoT systems differ from conventional IT systems in their ability to directly interact with the physical world (NIST IR 8316).</p><h6 id=glossary_nist_is>Information security (IS) (NIST)</h6><ul><li>the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</li></ul><h6 id=glossary_iso27000_is>Information security (IS) (ISO 27000:2018)</h6><ul><li>preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.</li></ul><p>Note: In addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.</p><h6 id=glossary_itaa2008_cybersec>Cyber security (CS) (ITAA-2008)</h6><ul><li>protecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</li></ul><p>Note 1: The definition is explicitly used for information technology (IT) elements and also for elements of operations technology (OT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).</p><p>Note 2: The terms Information Security (IS) and Cyber Security (CS) are often used interchangeably, since there are only some minor distinctions between the two terms. Notes 3 to 6 below provide guidance for specific situations in which one term is more appropriate than the other.</p><p>Note 3: In general, the information security is used in the context of securing information that is held and managed in both digital and non-digital (paper-based) forms. Cybersecurity is used in the context of securing the cyber-ecosystem (IT, OT, and IIoT) from cyber-attacks.</p><p>Note 4: Data and information content encompasses i) content created, used and managed using office productivity tools, ii) content stored in databases and other electronic repositories, which may be located on-premises or on cloud, iii) content searched, accessed and shared using web, email and other technologies, iv) machine to machine exchange of content through information exchange standards and protocols (EDI, API, STIX/TAXII), and OT-specific communication protocols (Modbus, DNP3/ IEEE 1815-2012, IEC-60870, IEC 61850, IEC 61131, IEC 62351) and, v) archival content stored in online and offline backups.</p><p>Note 5: Data and information related activities encompass i) content creation, updation and deletion (CRUD activities), ii) data processing, iii) view, copy, scan, search and print, iv) content integrity and confidentiality protection using digital signatures and encryption, v) masking or redaction of sensitive content and reclassification of the masked/ redacted content, vi) content exchange and distribution through electronic media and communication channels, vii) short-term and long-term storage of content and, viii) secure disposal of content from all the electronic stores, as per the organisation policies.</p><p>Note 6: Most OT systems are process control systems. Typically, the input and output OT data of such systems have a short period of utility. The most important concerns of such systems are the availability of the systems themselves, safety of the physical environment around the systems or influenced by them. The confidentiality of data exchanged through OT protocols, as well as intermittent data loss are minor concerns. As regards data integrity, the concern is more about the integrity of the process control systems that generate, consume and process the data using OT protocols. In summary, focus of OT security is more about protecting critical processes (Safety, Availability, Integrity) and less about data loss (Confidentiality).</p><h6 id=glossary_cyber_defence>Cyber defence</h6><ul><li>a set of defensive activities carried out across the organisation’s digital infrastructure by different teams of the organisation, by means of well-established practices and processes, with or without automation.</li></ul><p>Note 1: The objective of cyber defence is to protect the organisation’s digital infrastructure from harm and to ensure its availability for use by all authorised users.</p><p>Note 2: Cyber defence is similar to physical defence but in the cyberspace. Just as in physical defence, securing the digital infrastructure of the nation and/ or organisations requires both proactive actions like anticipating, continually observing and plugging breaches, and reactive measures like responding to and mitigating cyberattacks when they occur.</p><h6 id=glossary_nist_resilience>Resilience (NIST)</h6><ul><li>the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruption. Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents.</li></ul><h6 id=glossary_nist_cyberresilience>Cyber resilience (NIST)</h6><ul><li><p>the ability of an information system to operate under adverse conditions or stress, even if in a degraded or debilitated state, while maintaining essential operational capabilities, and to recover to an effective operational posture in a time frame consistent with mission needs.</p></li><li><p>the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.</p></li></ul><p>Note: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting the digital infrastructure from unauthorised access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. Cyber resilience is an organisation’s capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber threats and disruptions. Both functions require a combination of technologies, practices and processes, policies and controls, peope and governance for delivering the required outcomes.</p><h6 id=glossary_iso_iec_ieee_domain>Domain (ISO/IEC/IEEE)</h6><ul><li><p>distinct scope, within which common characteristics are exhibited, common rules observed, and over which a distribution transparency is preserved.</p></li><li><p>area of knowledge or activity characterized by a set of concepts and terminology understood by practitioners in that area.</p></li></ul><h6 id=glossary_nist_domain>Domain (NIST)</h6><ul><li>a set of elements, data, resources, and functions that share a commonality in combinations of (1) roles supported, (2) rules governing their use, and (3) protection needs.</li></ul><p>Note 1: Domain Coverage/ Scope - A domain’s coverage/ scope lists the elements, data, resources, processes and practices grouped under the domain, to reflect one or any combination of the following: i) capability, functional, or service distinctions; ii) data flow and control flow associated with capability, functional, or service distinctions; iii) data and information sensitivity; iv) data and information security; or v) administrative, management, operational, or jurisdictional authority.</p><p>Note 2: Domain Principle/ Objective - A domain&rsquo;s principle/ objective describes at a high level what an organisation is required to do/ achieve with regard to the requirements for the domain, using the triad of processes, people and technology.</p><p>Note 3: &ldquo;Domain&rdquo; is a widely used term by different practitioners to describe their working environments. For example, management teams use the term to describe distinct functional areas and job responsibilities. Systems and software engineering teams classify their work into different technical domains. HR and training teams define knowledge and skill domains to refer to different sets of concepts, topics and modules about which the professionals are expected to possess or develop the required competency. Security teams define security domains to categorise the security characteristics, policies and authorities. Cybersecurity capability maturity modelling research teams use distinct domains to classify, gather evidence and measure the capability and maturity of organisations.</p><h6 id=glossary_iso_38500_policy>Policy (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>intentions and direction of an organisation as formally expressed by its governing body or executive managers acting with appropriate authority.</li></ul><p>Note 1: A &ldquo;policy&rdquo; is a high-level statement of intent or direction that provides guidance to individuals and organisations on how they should act in specific circumstances. A policy is a formal declaration of an organisation&rsquo;s objectives, values, and principles, and it provides the basis for decision-making and the development of related processes, procedures, and controls.</p><p>Note 2: Policies are an important component of a management system, as they provide the overall direction and guidance for the management system and help to ensure that the management system is aligned with the organisation&rsquo;s objectives and values. Policies should be clear, concise, and aligned with the overall strategic objectives of the organisation, to enable the management system to deliver its intended outcomes.</p><p>Note 3: A policy typically defines a scope (business processes, departments and locations that will be covered by the policy), the external and internal environment of the organisation (to identify the interfaces and dependencies), and the business, IT, and information security objectives of the policy (what it seeks to achieve).</p><h6 id=glossary_practice>Practice</h6><ul><li>a set of activities that are <strong>continuously carried out</strong> over time, in pursuit of an organisation&rsquo;s strategic interests and goals.</li></ul><p>Note 1: A &ldquo;practice&rdquo; typically comprises of persons/ teams owning the practice, along with activities, governance, tools, and technology platforms to implement and operate the practice. The <strong>intelligence of the practice</strong>—how it gets something accomplished—is embedded in the complex, analytical and decision-making expertise of the practice owners (individuals/ teams). The <strong>key outcomes of a practice</strong> are continuous refinement, optimisation of effort and leveraging of the organisation&rsquo;s expertise. The adoption of best practices can help organisations to improve their performance, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve their goals more effectively.</p><h6 id=glossary_process>Process</h6><ul><li><p>set of interrelated or interacting activities that use inputs to deliver an intended result. (ISO 9000:2015)</p></li><li><p>a set of <strong>repeatable</strong> activities and tasks, usually designed as a set of well-defined steps with <strong>well-defined beginnings and ends</strong>, to get something done.</p></li></ul><p>Note 1: A “process” typically comprises of people, activities and tasks, governance, tools, and technology platforms to implement and execute the process. The execution steps of a process may be carried out sequentially or in parallel, either by a person, team or through automation. The <strong>intelligence of the process</strong>—how it gets something accomplished—is embedded in the process design and does not require complex decision-making by the persons or automation agents executing the steps. In other words, the process designer converts the knowledge of an activity or task into well-defined sequence of steps and records the same in the process documentation. People or automation agents are only supposed to know <strong>how</strong> to execute the steps laid down in the process documentation, without having to understand <strong>why</strong> they are to be done. The <strong>key outcomes of a process</strong> are standardisation, speed, efficiency and automation.</p><p>Note 2: There is no rigid hierarchy between practices and processes. A practice can have multiple sub-practices and/ or processes. Usually, over time, many practice owners convert parts of their practice into processes with well-defined execution steps and enable them using automation.</p><p>Note 3: Everything need not be a practice or a process. For example, activities and tasks that are performed infrequently, or those that do not have clear sequence of steps, can just be accomplished without defining a practice or process for the same. It is also important that practices and processes should not become the end goal by themselves but should only help reach the end goal.</p><p>Note 4: Parameters and metrics to quantify and measure a practice or process are designed so as to help improve and maintain their performance and effectiveness.</p><h6 id=glossary_procedure>Procedure</h6><ul><li><p>specified way to carry out an activity or a process, which may or may not be documented. (ISO 9000:2015)</p></li><li><p>a specific and documented way of performing a task or activity, to ensure that it is carried out consistently in its defined manner.</p></li></ul><p>Note 1: A procedure typically outlines the detailed steps to be followed by an individual, a team or automation to perform a task or activity to achieve the required outcomes of the task or activity. Procedures are more prescriptive and granular than processes.</p><h6 id=glossary_guidelines>Guidelines</h6><ul><li>a type of document that provides recommendations or suggestions on how to achieve a particular outcome or meet certain objectives.</li></ul><p>Note 1: Guidelines are intended to help users interpret and apply the requirements and principles set out in the applicable policies and standards, and to provide guidance and best practices for specific applications or contexts.</p><h6 id=glossary_control>Control</h6><ul><li>a mechanism to ensure that an activity or process is performed as intended. It comprises of a set of actions that should be taken to manage risk, prevent or mitigate negative outcomes, and ensure that the system is functioning as required.</li></ul><p>Note 1: In the context of cybersecurity, a control is a measure implemented to reduce risk and protect information assets. The specific risk or issue being addressed defines the type of control(s) to be used, which may be administrative controls, such as policies and procedures, technical controls, such as role-based access permissions or physical controls, such as locks and alarms.</p><h6 id=glossary_control_purpose>Control objective/ purpose</h6><ul><li>a statement that defines what a control is intended to achieve.</li></ul><p>Note 1: A control objective is a specific and measurable outcome that is desired from a control. It provides the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the control in relation to the risks or issues that the management system is designed to address.</p><p>Note 2: Control objectives/ purposes are an important component of a management system, as they provide the basis for defining and designing controls. Effective control objectives help organisations ensure that their management system is functioning effectively and achieving their objectives.</p><h4 id=glossary_governance_terms>Governance Terms</h4><h6 id=accountable-iso-385002015>Accountable (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>answerable for actions, decisions and performance.</li></ul><h6 id=accountability>Accountability</h6><ul><li><p>state of being accountable.

Independence in this context is demonstrated by the auditor&rsquo;s lack of involvement in the activities under review. External audits encompass both second and third-party evaluations. Second-party audits are performed by parties with a vested interest in the organization, like clients or their representatives. Third-party audits are carried out by independent external bodies, such as certification authorities or regulatory agencies.</p><p>Note 5: This constitutes one of the common terms and core definitions of the high-level structure for ISO management system standards. The original definition has been modified by adding Notes 3 and 4 to entry.</p><h6 id=authority>Authority</h6><ul><li>the right or power assigned to an individual or a government entity in order to achieve defined goals and objectives.
