The common baseline reference will ensure that the possibility of misunderstanding amongst the stakeholders is minimal.</p></li><li><p>Entities can get their organisations certified against specific management standards. The entities can also procure and use the other guidance and technical standards to help them in maximising the effectiveness during implementation.</p></li><li><p>There will be synergy between the entities and their internal/ external experts, consultants, implementers and auditors, since everyone refers to the same set of standards. In practice, this is already being done with regard to popular standards such as ISO 9000, ISO 27000 and IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>The oversight mechanism of Government bodies, regulators and national nodal agencies is easily harmonised when all bodies adopt a commonly accepted set of standards.</p></li><li><p>There is already a large pool of consultants, implementers and auditors in India, who have the knowledge, expertise and experience in implementing and auditing entities based on these standards. Capacity building of this pool, both in terms of quantity of personnel and quality of expertise, can be taken up through various national and international forums. Both ISO and IEC invest in strengthening the skills of its members, both at the human and the organisational level, through extensive training and technical assistance programmes. The capacity building programmes of ISO and IEC may be explored further.</p></li><li><p>BIS, a member of ISO and IEC, has a mechanism in place for standardisation and supply of standards at reasonable prices within the Indian ecosystem. Similarly, Department of Telecom (DoT) represents India at the ITU-T and QCI is a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), a worldwide association of accreditation bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment. Through these organisations, the Indian Government and ecosystem can maximise the effectiveness of use of globally recognised standards and frameworks.</p></li><li><p>The ISO and IEC are exploring new ways to provide dynamic deliverables that adapt to the needs of users in a much more flexible way.

The SMART standards will be modular, machine readable, and eventually, machine interpretable and executable. The corresponding Indian Standards can hugely benefit from this initiative.</p></li></ul><p>In view of the advantages listed above, the concepts and guidance have been built upon and aligned with a selected set of IS, ISO, IEC and ITU-T reference standards that are relevant and applicable to the Indian ecosystem. All the stakeholders are encouraged to develop their understanding of the core principles, approaches, methods and processes described in these base set of standards, so that the concepts and guidance can be used effectively. </p><p>The regulated and critical sector entities will benefit significantly if they obtain further guidance from the IS/ISO/IEC and other standards listed below:</p><ul><li><p>Governance of IT and information security, based on ISO/IEC 38500, 27014, COBIT etc</p></li><li><p>Service Management System (SMS) that are typically based on IS/ISO/IEC 20000 family.</p></li><li><p>Information Security Management System (ISMS) that are typically based on IS/ISO/IEC 27000 family, including sector specific standards.</p></li><li><p>ISO 27013 standard that assists organisations in implementing both ISO 27001 and ISO 20000-1 concurrently or in implementing one where another is already in place.</p></li><li><p>OT Security that are typically based on IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>Other standards related to IT asset management, audit etc.</p></li><li><p>Other frameworks such as NIST, CIS, CSA etc.</p></li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html rel=external target=_blank>https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/smart rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:6><p><a href=https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart rel=external target=_blank>https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article></div></main></div><aside id=R-sidebar class=default-animation><div id=R-header-topbar class=default-animation></div><div id=R-header-wrapper class=default-animation><div id=R-header class=default-animation><a id=R-logo class=R-default href=/index.html><div class=logo-title>Critical Sectors Community, India</div></a></div><search><form action=/search/index.html method=get><div class="searchbox default-animation"><button class=search-detail type=submit title="Search (CTRL+ALT+f)"><i class="fas fa-search"></i></button>
