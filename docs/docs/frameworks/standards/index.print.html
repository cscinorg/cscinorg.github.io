The common baseline reference will ensure that the possibility of misunderstanding amongst the stakeholders is minimal.</p></li><li><p>Entities can get their organisations certified against specific management standards. The entities can also procure and use the other guidance and technical standards to help them in maximising the effectiveness during implementation.</p></li><li><p>There will be synergy between the entities and their internal/ external experts, consultants, implementers and auditors, since everyone refers to the same set of standards. In practice, this is already being done with regard to popular standards such as ISO 9000, ISO 27000 and IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>The oversight mechanism of Government bodies, regulators and national nodal agencies is easily harmonised when all bodies adopt a commonly accepted set of standards.</p></li><li><p>There is already a large pool of consultants, implementers and auditors in India, who have the knowledge, expertise and experience in implementing and auditing entities based on these standards. Capacity building of this pool, both in terms of quantity of personnel and quality of expertise, can be taken up through various national and international forums. Both ISO and IEC invest in strengthening the skills of its members, both at the human and the organisational level, through extensive training and technical assistance programmes. The capacity building programmes of ISO and IEC may be explored further.</p></li><li><p>BIS, a member of ISO and IEC, has a mechanism in place for standardisation and supply of standards at reasonable prices within the Indian ecosystem. Similarly, Department of Telecom (DoT) represents India at the ITU-T and QCI is a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), a worldwide association of accreditation bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment. Through these organisations, the Indian Government and ecosystem can maximise the effectiveness of use of globally recognised standards and frameworks.</p></li><li><p>The ISO and IEC are exploring new ways to provide dynamic deliverables that adapt to the needs of users in a much more flexible way.

The processes can be used by acquirer organisations, suppliers (OEMs, system integrators, service providers) and management to fulfil their responsibilities pertaining to the system of interest. Processes are performed as required to achieve stated objectives within a lifecycle stage.</p><p>Organisations, when considering a new project, should select a life cycle model and the necessary life cycle processes to satisfy applicable life cycle stage entry or exit criteria. Decisions as to which processes to select should be based on cost-benefit or risk reduction.</p><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 provides a specific example of four groups of system life cycle processes: Agreement, Organisational Project-enabling, Technical Management and Technical. The same is depicted in Figure 2-4, along with sub clause numbers of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 in which the specific purpose, expected outcomes, activities and tasks of the processes are described.</p><p><strong>Organisational Project-Enabling processes</strong> provide enabling resources and infrastructure that are used to create, support, and monitor projects and to assess project effectiveness. <strong>Technical Management processes </strong>provide requirements so that adequate planning, assessment, and control activities are performed to manage processes and life cycle stages. The role of these two groups of processes is to achieve the project goals within applicable life cycle stages to satisfy an agreement. The <strong>Technical Processes</strong> are used to perform life cycle related work related to engineering of systems.</p><p>Projects may need to establish relationships with other projects within the organisation, as well as those in other organisations. Such relationships are established through the <strong>Agreement processes</strong> of acquisition and supply. The degree of formality of the agreement is adapted to the internal or external business relationships between projects.</p><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=architectural-description>Architectural Description</h1><p>One of the major challenges of large projects with multiple stakeholders is the documentation to help various stakeholders understand the characteristics, features and design of the system, and to establish a common reference among parties involved in the deployment, operation, maintenance and support of the system. The ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> Architecture Description (AD) international standard helps organisations to express and document architecture descriptions of large and complex systems in a standardised manner.</p><p>Every complex system has multiple stakeholders across the federated digital ecosystem. Expressing a system’s architecture using AD will help all the stakeholders to understand its evolution, composition, behaviour and maintainability. The AD methodology is useful to specify requirements of various entities, including software, systems, enterprises, systems of systems, families of systems, products (goods or services), product lines, service lines, technologies and business domains. The Architectural Description conceptual foundations<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> are summarised below.</p><h4 id=ad-concepts>AD Concepts</h4><ul><li><p>A <a href=/docs/glossary/terms/index.html#glossary_system><strong>system</strong></a> is situated in an <strong>environment</strong>. The environment of a system may contain other systems. The system’s environment is bounded by and understood through the identification and analysis of the system’s stakeholders and their concerns. The environment determines the totality of influences upon the system throughout its life cycle, including its interactions with that environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholders</strong> have interests in a system, which are expressed as <strong>concerns</strong>. Concerns arise throughout the life cycle from system needs and requirements, from design choices and from implementation and operating considerations. A concern could manifest in many forms, such as in relation to one or more stakeholder needs, goals, expectations, responsibilities, requirements, design constraints, assumptions, dependencies, quality attributes, architecture decisions, risks or other issues pertaining to the system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architecture of a system</strong> constitutes what is essential about the system in relation to its environment (in an abstract form). The term <strong>system-of-interest</strong> is also used to refer to the system whose architecture is under consideration in the preparation of an AD.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architecture descriptions</strong> (AD) are used to express architectures for systems of interest (in a documented form). They include one or more Architecture Views that address the concerns of stakeholders. AD may include information not part of any architecture view. Examples include system overview, architecture rationale etc.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Architecture Viewpoint</strong> frames one or more concerns and a concern can be framed by more than one viewpoint. Examples of viewpoints are i) business/ mission viewpoint, ii) deployment viewpoint.</p></li><li><p>Each Architecture Viewpoint has exactly one <strong>Architecture View</strong> that expresses the architecture of the system of interest in accordance with the Architecture Viewpoint and addresses the concerns framed by the governing viewpoint. Thus, a viewpoint is a way of looking at systems and a view is a result of applying a viewpoint. Examples of views are i) business/ mission view, ii) deployment view, iii) operations view.</p></li><li><p>Architecture View is composed of one or more <strong>Architecture Models</strong>. Each architectural model is developed using the conventions and methods established by its associated viewpoint. An architectural model may participate in more than one view. Consistency between the views is maintained using <strong>correspondence rules</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architecture decisions</strong> pertain to system concerns. <strong>Architecture rationale</strong> records explanations, justifications and reasoning about architectural decisions. The rationale for a decision may include the basis for the decision, alternatives and trade-offs considered, and potential consequences of the decision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Execution views</strong> consist of a set of models that describe and document what a software system does at runtime and how it does it. The term runtime refers to the actual time that the software system is functioning during testing or in the ﬁeld.</p></li></ul><h4 id=architecting>Architecting</h4><p>Architecting is an activity that is performed throughout the system lifecycle within the context of a project and/ or organisation. An architecture description is a work product resulting from the execution of architecting activities within the lifecycle of the system of interest. Annexure C of ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 demonstrates the use of architecting in the context of system and software lifecycle processes defined by ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207 respectively.</p><h4 id=uses-of-architectural-descriptions>Uses of Architectural Descriptions</h4><p>Some of the uses of architecture description methodology by various stakeholders throughout the system life cycle are given below:</p><ul><li><p>as basis for system design and development activities</p></li><li><p>as basis to analyse and evaluate alternative implementations of an architecture</p></li><li><p>as development and maintenance documentation</p></li><li><p>documenting essential aspects of a system, such as:</p><ul><li><p>intended use and environment</p></li><li><p>principles, assumptions and constraints to guide future change</p></li><li><p>points of flexibility or limitations of the system with respect to future changes</p></li><li><p>architecture decisions, their rationales and implications</p></li></ul></li><li><p>as input to automated tools for simulation, system generation and analysis</p></li><li><p>specifying a group of systems sharing common features</p></li><li><p>communicating among parties involved in the development, production, deployment, operation and maintenance of a system</p></li><li><p>as basis for preparation of acquisition documents (such as requests for proposal and statements of work)</p></li><li><p>communicating among clients, acquirers, suppliers and developers as a part of contract negotiations</p></li><li><p>documenting the characteristics, features and design of a system for potential clients, acquirers, owners, operators and integrators</p></li><li><p>planning for transition from a legacy architecture to a new architecture</p></li><li><p>as guide to operational and infrastructure support and configuration management</p></li><li><p>as support to system planning, scheduling and budgeting activities</p></li><li><p>establishing criteria for certifying implementations for compliance with an architecture</p></li><li><p>as compliance mechanism to external and project and/or organization-internal policies</p></li><li><p>as basis for review, analysis, and evaluation of the system across its life cycle</p></li><li><p>as basis to analyse and evaluate alternative architectures</p></li><li><p>sharing lessons learned and reusing architectural knowledge through viewpoints, patterns and styles</p></li><li><p>training and education of stakeholders and other parties on best practices in architecting and system evolution.</p></li></ul><h3 id=example-of-application-of-ad-concepts>Example of Application of AD Concepts</h3><p>Application of the Architectural Description concepts to a sample project is given below.

Systems security engineering is a subdiscipline of systems engineering that addresses security-relevant considerations intended to produce secure outcomes.</p><p>In recent years there is a clear recognition that “Systems security engineering must be fundamental to systems engineering.

Rather, it requires a transdisciplinary approach to protection, a determination across all assets where loss could occur, and an understanding of adversity, including how adversaries attack and compromise systems. It addresses security issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements and protection needs and the use of established engineering processes to ensure that such requirements and needs are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor across the entire life cycle of the system.”</p><p>This publication describes the security design principles, concepts, and techniques that are part of a trustworthy secure design approach. These can be applied in the development of new capabilities or systems, modification of existing capabilities or systems, and development of system of systems. It is intended to be used by:</p><ul><li><p>Systems engineers, security engineers, and other engineering professionals.</p></li><li><p>Professionals and teams, who perform other system life cycle activities or tasks, such as those listed below</p><ul><li><p>Security governance, risk management, and oversight</p></li><li><p>Security verification, validation, testing, evaluation, auditing, assessment, inspection, and monitoring</p></li><li><p>Acquisition, budgeting, and project management</p></li><li><p>Operations, maintenance, sustainment, logistics, and support</p></li><li><p>Providers of technology-related products, systems, or services</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The core objective of the publication is to be engineering-based, not operations- or technology-based. Organisations can adapt the concepts and principles for trustworthy secure design, the systems life cycle processes and security-relevant activities and tasks described in the publication to achieve consistent security outcomes in the capabilities delivered by their systems.</p><p><strong>System Security Viewpoints</strong></p><p>The publication defines three predominant viewpoints of system security, viz i) system function, ii) security function, and iii) life cycle assets.</p><ul><li><p><strong>System function</strong> is the system’s purpose or role as fulfilled by the totality of the capability it delivers combined with its intended use. Every system is required to satisfy all the stakeholder capability needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security function</strong> is the system’s fulfilment of the stakeholder’s protection capability needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life cycle assets</strong> are associated with the system but are not engineered into or delivered with the system. Life cycle assets typically include intellectual property, data and information associated with the system, and supporting assets for development, production and sustenance of the system. The association of lifecycle assets with the system means that they can be the direct cause of loss or a conduit/means through which a loss can occur.</p></li><li><p>The system function is the predominant viewpoint and establishes the context for the security function and the associated system life cycle assets.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Systems Security Engineering Framework</strong></p><p>The systems security engineering framework provides a conceptual view of the key contexts within which systems security engineering activities are conducted. It defines three contexts for conducting activities and tasks:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>problem context</strong> to help ensure that the engineering is driven by a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>solution context</strong> to drive the effort to provide the solution, supported by a set of activities to design and realize the solution.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>trustworthiness context</strong> is a decision-making context that provides an evidence-based demonstration – through reasoning – that the system of interest is deemed trustworthy (or not) based on a set of claims derived from security objectives.</p></li></ul><h3 id=nist-sp-800-160-vol-2>NIST SP 800-160 Vol 2</h3><p>Cyber resiliency for systems that include or depend on cyber resources is a part of operational resilience but needs specific guidance due to its distinctive characteristics. The publication provides guidance on how to apply cyber resiliency concepts, constructs, and engineering practices to systems security engineering and risk management. It is to be used by systems security engineering and other professionals, who are responsible for activities and tasks related to system life cycle and risk management processes within and external to the organisation.</p><p>While much of the cyber resiliency analysis in the publication uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&amp;CK™) framework, organisations are not constrained to use only the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework but can use other frameworks too.</p><p>Useful concepts from the publication are described below. Readers are advised to consult the publication for detailed information and guidance on cyber resiliency.</p><p><strong>Cyber-resilient systems</strong> are systems that have security measures or safeguards “built in” as a foundational part of the architecture and design and that display a high level of resiliency to withstand cyber-attacks, faults, and failures and continue to operate in a degraded or debilitated state to carry out the mission-essential functions of the organisation.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency engineering practices</strong> are the methods, processes, modelling, and analytical techniques used to identify and analyse proposed solutions. These practices are applied in system life cycle processes so that the resultant <strong>cyber resiliency solutions</strong> are aligned with the stakeholder requirements and protection needs.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency engineering framework</strong> provides constructs that include cyber resiliency goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, and design principles. While these constructs are applied at the system level in the publication, they can also be applied beyond the system level to mission and business function level, organisational level and sector level. The framework is based on Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework developed by the MITRE Corporation<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>,<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>.</p><p>Cyber resiliency goals and objectives provide a vocabulary for describing what properties and capabilities are needed. Cyber resiliency techniques, approaches, and design principles provide a vocabulary for discussing how a system can achieve its cyber resiliency goals and objectives.</p><p>Four cyber resiliency goals, namely Anticipate, Withstand, Recover and Adapt, eight cyber resiliency objectives and 14 cyber resiliency techniques are part of the cyber resiliency engineering framework.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency solutions</strong> are relevant only if they have some effect on risk. Hence their primary focus is to reduce the risk by reducing the three core factors</p><ul><li>the <strong>likelihood of occurrence</strong> of threat events,</li><li>the ability of threat events to cause harm, i.e., the <strong>likelihood of impact</strong>,</li><li>the extent of harm from threat events, i.e., the <strong>level of impact</strong>.</li></ul><p>The publication describes three models, namely the <strong>risk model, threat model</strong> and <strong>consequence (impact) model</strong> for cyber resiliency. It further identifies controls from NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 that directly support cyber resiliency. The principle applied for associating controls with cyber resiliency is that “cyber resiliency is about ensuring continued mission operations despite the fact that an adversary has established a foothold in the organisation’s systems and cyber infrastructure”. It also provides guidance on adversary-oriented analysis for achieving cyber resiliency, specifically the perspective of protecting systems against adversarial threats using MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ for Enterprise<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> and ATT&amp;CK™ for Industrial Control Systems (ICS)<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> frameworks.
