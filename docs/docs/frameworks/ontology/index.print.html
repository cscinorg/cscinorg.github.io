This section defines an ontology of tags that categorises various characterstiscs of a federated digital ecosystem. The tags will enable a common specification, representation and communication of the use of IT and cybersecurity amongst the governing bodies, top and senior management and technical teams, both within entities and the external organisations interacting with the entities.</p><p>Three <strong>tag-groups</strong> are defined, as under:</p><p><strong>A. Resource categorisation</strong></p><p><strong>B. Hierarchical level</strong></p><p><strong>C. Trust level</strong></p><p>The ontology is designed in a technology-agnostic manner so that it can understood by both business and technical persons. The tags are meant to be used in architecture diagrams and presentations to give the business and technical management a common mechanism to specify the characteristics of IT and cybersecurity elements in the federated digital ecosystem. They are also to be used in discussions with external organiations. <strong>The objective is to facilitate common understanding of situations and enable appropriate decision-making.</strong></p><h2 id=a-resource-categorisation-tags>A. Resource Categorisation Tags</h2><p>The resource categorisation tags are designed for use by the technology level practitioners to establish a common understanding with the goveranance and business levels about the type and level of control they have over their information infrastructure elements. The list of tags in this group are as under:</p><ul><li>Resource zones - central (S) or end-user (U).</li><li>In-use resources purpose and use – functional (FS, FU) or governance/ management/ administration (GS, GU).</li><li>Connectivity zones (V).</li><li>Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD).</li><li>Connectivity ownership (VA, VB, VC, VD).</li><li>Connectivity purpose and use (XA, XB, XC, XD).</li><li>End user resource ownership (UA, UB, UC, UD).</li><li>End user role (NU, OU).</li><li>Control over human workforce (WA, WB, WC, WD).</li><li>Services (DC, IS, OS, TS, SS, FM).</li><li>Service ownership (JA, JB, JC, JD).</li><li>Data centre segmentation (ML1 to ML4).</li><li>Cloud services segmentation (YL0 to YL4)</li></ul><h3 id=resource-zones>Resource Zones</h3><p>The resource zones are of two types:</p><p><strong>Central Resource Zones (S Zones):</strong> These zones host the in-use operating resources (servers, applications, databases) of different business processes and management systems, as well as the local networking and security infrastructure. The central zones are located physically within the data centres or the local server rooms in regional/ branch offices. These zones are tagged as System or <strong>‘S’ zones</strong>.</p><p><strong>End User Resource Zones (U Zones):</strong> These zones host the in-use operating resources (computing devices, applications, data repositories) of end users and their local networking and security infrastructure. The users may be human or machine and are typically identified by their credentials (user and machine ids) that are linked to centrally managed user and system accounts. The user zones are generally located physically within the office premises of organisations or work/ home premises of remote users. These zones are tagged as User or <strong>‘U’ zones</strong>.</p><h3 id=in-use-resources>In-Use Resources</h3><p>Computer resources (assets) of entities may lie in the store or be deployed for use. The resources deployed and in-use in central and end-user zones can be categorised as under, based on their purpose and use. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘S’ or ‘U’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Resource Use Type</th><th>Resource Use Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FS, FU</td><td>Functional Use</td><td>The resources are used for business functions, services, operations, and analytics. These include computer resources (web servers, app servers, db servers, etc) of different critical business/ industrial processes.</td></tr><tr><td>GS. GU</td><td>Governance, Management and Administration Use</td><td>The resources are used for governance, management, and administration. These include computer resources to configure, manage, monitor, control, analyse and report the functional, performance and cybersecurity aspects of the computer resources deployed in the operational zones.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><ol><li><p>Typically, the resources used for operational and management functions are physically and logically segmented into separate sub-zones within the hierarchical levels described in later sections.</p></li><li><p>The in-use computer resources (assets) of an organisation can be categorised and tagged based on their functions and capabilities, as well as by the zones in which they are deployed. The tags can be used to apply detailed guidance on the information security imperatives and requirements of each in-use resource based on its function and the zone in which it is deployed.</p></li></ol><h4 id=types-of-functional-resources-fs-fu-tag>Types of Functional Resources (FS, FU Tag)</h4><p>The detailed categorisation of computer resources based on the functions and capabilities is described in a separate section. The in-use computer resources can usually be tagged as under.</p><h5 id=end-user-resources>End User Resources:</h5><ul><li>User and machine credentials stored in smart cards, USB tokens or 2FA through mobile devices.</li><li>Endpoint computing devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile)</li><li>Audio and video conferencing devices</li><li>Wired and wireless network access devices, Bluetooth, Zigbee, WLAN</li><li>SSL VPN termination, VPN clients</li><li>Applications and data repositories</li><li>Endpoint agents installed on compute devices.</li></ul><h5 id=cloud-services-and-resources>Cloud Services and Resources:</h5><ul><li>Subscription Services: Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), As-a-Service Applications (email, portal, eOffice etc), CTI Feeds.</li></ul><h5 id=perimeter-devices>Perimeter Devices:</h5><ul><li>Perimeter zones will have connectivity devices that provide physical and logical conduit between the two zones and physical (human) and logical (network) ingress/ egress control devices (gateway), data diode.</li><li>Firewall, IDS, IPS, UTM, NAC appliance, Router, switch, VPN gateway, SSL terminator, communication network termination device, OT: GPRS modem, FO modem, smartcard/ biometric readers, network taps, IPSEC/ SSL VPN termination points.</li></ul><h5 id=data-centre-resources>Data Centre Resources:</h5><ul><li>Web Proxy, Email Proxy, API gateway, Load Balancer, Data Leakage Protection, Content Disarm & Reconstruct (CDR), Switch</li><li>Enterprise Zone Data Centre (segmented into multiple trust zones (VLANs), based on functional and security design): server cluster, server farm, VMs and containers, storage, consoles, SW stack, business systems (ERP)</li><li>Datacentre network (DCN), compute, VMs and containers.</li></ul><h5 id=zones-specific-to-ot-and-iiot>Zones specific to OT and IIoT:</h5><ul><li>OT supervisory L2: Industrial PCs, SCADA, DCS, HMI, FEP, Historian, Engineering Workstation, switch</li><li>OT basic control L1: PLC, RTU, IED, BCU</li><li>IIoT edge devices L1: surveillance cameras, biometric and smart card readers</li><li>OT L0: relay, sensor, actuator, generic OT process devices</li></ul><h4 id=types-of-governance-and-management-resources-gs-tag>Types of Governance and Management Resources (GS Tag)</h4><p>These resources can be broadly categorised as:</p><ul><li>Platforms that discover, provision, configure, monitor, manage functionality, performance, and security, visualise, control, analyse, govern, and report the trustworthiness (functionality and assurance) of operational systems (computer resources).</li><li>Cloud Services Management (Infrastructure, Platforms, Software, Security, Backup, BCP, DR services), Domain management, SMIME/ SSL certificate management, email, and web services.</li><li>Subscription feeds: OEM Patches and Feeds, OEM telemetry collectors, AV/ EPP management, Domain manager, Certificate Authority, OAuth IdPs.</li><li>Datacentre network (DCN) management: physical access control, CCTV monitoring, BIMS, UPS & Generators DNS, DHCP, RADIUS, network access control (NAC) management.</li><li>Management platforms and tools: IT/OT asset management (ITAM), asset configuration management (CMDB), asset discovery, IdAM (AD) & privileged identity and access management, LDAP, credential management, API secrets management, certificate management, NMS/EMS, patch management, vulnerability & compliance management, database activity monitoring (DAM), key lifecycle management (KLM), policy management, SSH management, log & flow collectors, SIEM, EDR, NDR, XDR, SOAR, endpoint/ AV protection (EPP), forensic tools, ITSM, ISMS, BCMS, data backup.</li><li>Log collection from all in-use computer resources and flow collection from all networks.</li></ul><h3 id=connectivity-zones>Connectivity Zones</h3><p>These zones host the Wide Area Network (WAN) network provider infrastructure that provide the conduits for voice, video, and data connectivity between the resource zones. The connectivity zones are usually owned and managed by TSPs and ISPs and are accessed by means of customer premises equipment (CPE) that are installed in the resource zones connecting to the WAN. These zones are tagged as <strong>‘V’ zones,</strong> say Connectivity Zone.</p><p>The connectivity (V) zone of an entity is, in effect, a resource (S) zone of the TSP and ISP.</p><h3 id=data-centre-ownership>Data Centre Ownership</h3><p>All data centres and server rooms hosting the central resources are categorised as under, based on their ownership. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘S’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Data Centre Type</th><th>Data Centre Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SA</td><td>Entity Owned</td><td>Captive data centres and server rooms owned by the entity.</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>GOE Owned</td><td>Data centres of Govt Owned Entity (NIC, SDCs, PSUs).</td></tr><tr><td>SC</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Data centres of Privately Owned CSP, India based DC facilities.</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Data centres of Privately Owned CSP, multi country DC facilities.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><p>The above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk and compliance aspects of data centre and cloud service providers, while providing strategic direction to the use of IT. For example, the risk of non-compliance of data localisation requirement is higher in the case of Type SD as compared to Type SC.</p><p><strong>Tag SA</strong> entity owned private cloud is exclusive to the organisation, which may be hosted on-premises or in a site hired from a property owner. This corresponds to the pattern where an organisation provides its own captive cloud services.</p><p><strong>Tag SB</strong> GOE owned cloud is typically mandated for almost all the critical business functions of CSEs. Many common services like email, portals, eOffice and other IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS/ DRaaS are provided as cloud services to the Govt Community.</p><p><strong>Tag SC</strong> private cloud service providers with India-only data centres are easily able to comply with data localisation requirements that can be verified using lower levels of audit effort. Such CSP data centres are preferable when data localisation requirement as well as control over data storage outside of India is of high priority.</p><p><strong>Tag SD</strong> private cloud service providers with multi-country data centres include the i) the likes of global CSPs like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle, SAP; ii) OEM service management related to OEM patches, vulnerability feeds and sending system telemetry back to the OEMs, specifically relevant to OT OEM support services that are provided from OEM support cloud installations.; iii) third-party managed services (MSPs and MSSPs) covering both Indian and non-Indian ownership and control; iv) content delivery network (CDN) providers; v) domain name providers, digital certificate issuers, PKI management providers like DigiCert, DNS and other security service providers like Cloudflare etc.</p><p>The key advantages of tag SD CSPs are that they can provide very high levels of infrastructure scaling, availability, and business continuity. A large pool of trained and experienced professionals is also available for such CSPs, and these professionals can be easily hired to manage and secure the zones implemented in these CSP data centres. These CSPs can comply with data residency within the Indian geography but cannot easily prove compliance that data is not also residing outside of India. Significant audit effort is required to verify the same. Hence, such CSP data centres are relevant when an organisation requires very high and dynamic scalability or has to provide its services beyond the national boundaries or when there are no major concerns related to copies of data being stored outside of India.</p><h3 id=connectivity-ownership>Connectivity Ownership</h3><p>These zones host the Wide Area Network (WAN) network provider infrastructure that provide the conduits for voice, video, and data connectivity between the resource zones. These zones are tagged as <strong>‘V’ zones</strong>.</p><p>The connectivity providers are categorised as under, based on their ownership. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘V’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Connectivity Type</th><th>Connectivity Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VA</td><td>Entity Owned</td><td>Captive WAN and mobile networks owned by the entity.</td></tr><tr><td>VB</td><td>GOE Owned</td><td>WAN and mobile networks of Govt Owned Entity (NICNET, NKN, PSUs).</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Networks of Private TSP/ ISP, managed from India based facilities (Airtel, Reliance, Vodafone-Idea).</td></tr><tr><td>VD</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Networks of Private TSP/ISP managed from outside India. Example, global satellite communication providers.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><p>The above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of connectivity providers (TSPs/ ISPs), while providing strategic direction to the use of IT. For example, the national security risk due to misuse of the monitored traffic patterns is higher in the case of Type VD as compared to Types VA, VB, or VC.</p><h3 id=connectivity-use>Connectivity Use</h3><p>The connectivity can be categorised as under, based on the purpose and use. The tags are derived from the primary tag <strong>‘X’</strong>, to identify the network topography:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Characteristics of Connectivity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>XA</td><td>Closed user group (CUG).</td></tr><tr><td>XB</td><td>Intra-organisation: Intranet (WAN), local area network (LAN), data centre networking (DCN).</td></tr><tr><td>XC</td><td>Inter-organisation: Extranet (WAN).</td></tr><tr><td>XD</td><td>Public: Internet.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Tag XA</strong> is typically used for high security closed user groups, which use captive networks or encryption devices on less secure networks. Entities also use VPN to create closed user groups for privileged users, who typically have to connect to the data centres to provide remote support.</p><p><strong>Tag XB</strong> is typically used for intranet connectivity of regional and branch offices through MPLS Cloud, Leased Lines or Site-to-Site VPNs. This also includes remote OT cells/ areas within an OT Site that typically connect to the OT site operations/ DMZ on wired LAN.</p><p><strong>Tag XC</strong> is typically used for extranet connectivity through MPLS Cloud, Leased Lines or Site-to-Site VPNs. Examples are RBI Infinet, NIC NKN, Power sector grid operation networks between substations and control centres etc.</p><p><strong>Tag XD</strong> is typically used for internet connectivity through wired/ wireless broadband and mobile networks provided by the Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p><h3 id=end-user-resource-ownership>End User Resource Ownership</h3><p>The end user resource ownerships are categorised as under, based on the organisation to which the human user or machine belongs. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘U’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>User Org Type</th><th>User Organisation Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>UA</td><td>Own Organisation</td><td>Human user or machine belongs to the entity itself.</td></tr><tr><td>UB</td><td>Other Organisation</td><td>Human user or machine belongs to another entity with which there is a formal and established relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>UC</td><td>Other Organisation</td><td>Human user or machine belongs to another entity with which there is no formal or established relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>UD</td><td>No Organisation</td><td>Human user or machine does not belong to any entity, viz a private individual or his machine.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><p>The above categorisation helps</p><ul><li>the design and implementation teams and the operations managers to establish and ensure appropriate controls in different end user zones.</li><li>the top and senior management to monitor the risks.</li><li>the audit teams to check policy non-compliances.</li></ul><p>Entities have a high level of control over tag UA resources, whether they are used for connecting through the Internet or Intranet. The organisation can enforce that the end-user devices must have adequate endpoint protection (AV, anti-malware etc) and comply with organisational policies (patches/ updates, upgrades, password policy enforcement, authorised applications, VPN usage etc). These controls can even be enforced and centrally managed on the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) of remote workers.</p><p>Entities have a lower level of control over tag UB, UC resources that belong to other Organizations. In most cases, the user’s organisation is responsible for configuring, securing, and managing the end user resources. Other organisation’s users (humans and machines) typically connect to one’s own organisation’s information infrastructure through the Extranet. Other organisation users may also connect using IPSEC or SSL VPNs over the Internet. One’s own organisation must depend upon the other organisation’s policies and processes of control over the end-user devices in terms of their endpoint protection and compliance to policies. Formal and established relationships between entities help to increase the trust in the human users and machines of the other entities.</p><p>Entities do not have any control over tag UD resources, the end-user devices of public users, who connect to organisation’s information infrastructure through the Internet, typically using browser or mobile applications. Machine to machine connections from public users/ Organizations to an organisation’s systems are generally API-based.</p><h3 id=end-user-role>End User Role</h3><p>The end user resources are categorised as under, based on the role of the human user or machine.

This is done by the organisation themselves for resource categories WA and WB or by the service provider for resource categories WC and WD. Some Organizations also invest into the technical skill development of their WB resources (contractual employees).</p><p>The administrative functions related to the workforce covers aspects of skill verification and documentation during workforce onboarding, contract management, compliance to laws and regulation. This is done by the organisation itself for its own employees under resource category WA or by the resource/ service provider for resource categories WB, WC, and WD. Some Organizations manage the compensation payments and payment of GST for resource categories WB by themselves, while others let the workforce resource provider do the same.</p><p>The physical and IT access control of the workforce covers aspects of physical entry into the organisation’s premises and places of work within the organisation. It also covers access to IT and OT resources, both on-premises and remotely through the network. All Organizations control the physical access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC. The Organizations also control the IT access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC when they are on the organisation’s premises. In case of remote working of WC and WD category workforce, the service providers decide which person is assigned to remotely manage their customer organisation’s IT / OT infrastructure and further controls the IT access of the assigned resource as per the SLAs signed with the customer organisation.</p><p>The above workforce control categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate and provide strategic direction on the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of i) the workforce employed to operate and manage their central resources in data centres, and ii) the workforce employed by their outsourced and managed service providers (WC and WD).</p><p>For example, the risk of data leakage is higher from those providers of outsourced and managed services (WC, WD), who do not have good due diligence processes to hire, train and monitor their own and contractual employees, or they are further outsourcing the work to second tier service providers. Due diligence is especially important for workforce having privileged user (OU) rights.</p><p>A strategic assessment of the level of control available to an entity with regard to the outsourced workforce (WC and WD) operating and managing its resource and connectivity zones would help the entity identify the SLAs that should be in place with the outsourced and managed service providers. The SLAs should especially cover the control, monitoring, and oversight on the privileged users (OU) of the service providers since these highly skilled users generally work remotely.</p><h3 id=service-ownership>Service Ownership</h3><p>The modern federated digital ecosystem is largely driven by services. In general, a Service Provider Entity (<strong>SPE</strong>) delivers a service to a Customer Entity (<strong>CE)</strong>, who acquires the service. The relationship between the SPE and the CE may be formal, semi-formal or informal, depending upon the type of service agreements that exist between them.</p><p>The services related to IT, OT and Information Security infrastructure are categorised as under:</p><ul><li>Data <strong>Centre Services</strong> (<strong>DC</strong>): These are typically provided by Cloud Service Provider Entities (<strong>CSP</strong>).</li><li>Telecom <strong>and Internet Services</strong> (<strong>IS</strong>): These services include voice, video and data communication services that are provided by telecom and internet service provider entities (<strong>TSP, ISP</strong>).</li><li>Operation <strong>Support Services</strong> (<strong>OS</strong>): These services include NOC, SOC, call centres, customer service centres etc.</li><li>Technology <strong>Support services</strong> (<strong>TS</strong>): These services include L1 to L3 support services and managed services that are usually provided by second- or third-party entities such as OEMs and/or their partners, SIs, MSPs, MSSPs etc. These services are usually contracted with formal service level agreements between the customer (CE) and the service provider entity (SPE).</li><li>Subscription <strong>services</strong> (<strong>SS</strong>): These services include all types of subscriptions and are typically in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feeds, vulnerability, and compliance (SCAP) feeds, open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds, remote health monitoring service etc. These services may either be i) contracted by the CE with formal service level agreements with the SPE, or ii) non-contracted best effort services that have no formal SLAs between the CE and the SPE. The SPEs themselves may be source (feed) owners or feed aggregators.</li><li>Non**-IT Facility Management Services** (<strong>FM</strong>): These services include power supply, site, and facility management (physical security, non-IT infrastructure) services etc.</li></ul><p>In the modern federated digital ecosystem, the SPE and the CE may be different entities by themselves or may be different business units within large Organizations and the Government (e.g. NIC and SDCs are SPEs to govt departments (CEs)).</p><p>The SPEs are categorised as under, based on their ownership and location.

They are also responsible for the workforce handling these functions. For example,</p><p><strong>ML1</strong> is owned, operated, managed, and secured by the Property Manager (FM-SPE), who is responsible for ingress/ egress control into the property, campus security and safety. The workforce handling these functions are contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p><strong>ML2</strong> is owned by the DC-SPE and managed by the DC Site Manager, who is responsible for DC operations and management. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the DC-SPE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p><strong>ML3</strong> is owned by the FM-SPE, who are responsible for operations and management of their services. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the FM-SPE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p><strong>ML4</strong> is owned by the Customer Entity (CE), who is responsible for the operations and management of their platforms and subscribed services. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the CE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p>In the case of entity owned data centres and server rooms (SA), the entity is both the DC-SPE and the CE. In case the entity also owns the inter-data centre and customer connectivity (VA), then the entity is also the IS-SPE for its intranet connectivity facilities.</p><p>In other cases (SB, SC, SD), there is a supplier and acquirer relationship between the DC-SPE and CE regarding the provisioning and use of cloud services. Cloud service customers can also consider multiple cloud service providers together as a cloud services supply chain.</p><p>The IS/ISO/IEC 27036: Part 4:2016 provides guidance on supplier relationship between the cloud service customer (acquirer) and the cloud service provider (supplier). IS/ISO/IEC 27002 clause 15 &ldquo;Supplier relationships&rdquo; provides controls, implementation guidance and other information for managing information security in supplier relationships. IS/ISO/IEC 27017:2015 provides guidelines on information security controls suitable for cloud services provision and usage, that can provide guidance to the DC-SPE and the CE. The DC-SPEs also obtain certification of compliance to various standards that are applicable to cloud services, such as IS/ISO/IEC 20000-1, SOC-2 etc. These standards are described in the compendium.</p><p>As per industry practice, the resource provisioning and orchestration functions are carried out by the DC-SPE. However, the responsibility of operation, management and security of customer subscribed data centre resources is shared between the DC-SPE and CE based on the type of cloud computing model that the CE has subscribed to from the DC-SPE. These are broadly classified into IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, XaaS etc. NIST SP 800-145, SP 500-292, and SP 500-332 provide detail guidance on cloud computing models.</p><h3 id=segmentation-of-cloud-services>Segmentation of Cloud Services</h3><p>The cloud computing resource types given in the table below are adapted from the industry practice in a manner that it can also be applied to entity-owned captive data centres and GOE owned data centres.

Neither the organisation nor the ISP can enforce any security policies for network traffic that passes through the public network.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Public users anonymously accessing an organisation’s website over the Internet or mobile network.</p><h4 id=low-trust-zone>Low Trust Zone</h4><p>Characteristics:</p><p>When applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a minimal set of security policies that users and systems in the Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. Typically, no anonymous access is provided, and all users and systems must be registered with an organisation, using their username & password or allocated API secret.</p><p>When applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of VPNs controlled by the organisation or a trustworthy network connectivity provider, who has well defined network security policies for the Connectivity Zone.</p><p>Applicable to:</p><p>External users and systems that can connect to an organisation’s zone after pre-registration and through session-based authentication, they are also required to use browser-based (https) or client-based VPNs, which are controlled by the organisation and governed by the organisation’s security policies.</p><p>External users and systems of other Organizations connecting through trusted extranet connectivity providers.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Public users connecting to an organisation’s website through the Internet or mobile network using a browser or app-based SSL VPN and further logging into their user account before doing any further activity.</p><p>Applications on the devices of public users and Organizations, which connect to an organisation’s API gateways by using registered API secrets.</p><p>NICNET and NKN based extranets that provide network interconnectivity between different Organizations. The network connectivity provider defines the set of security policies that the organisational users and systems should comply with when they are connected to the network.</p><p>Remote management and support provided by OEMs, System Integrators, Managed Service Providers (MSPs & MSSPs) from their support zones, which are governed by their own security policies. In these cases, the remote support providers either connect through VPN clients installed on their devices or there would be well-managed site-to-site VPNs between the customer and support provider Organizations.</p><h4 id=standard-trust-zone>Standard Trust Zone</h4><p>Characteristics:</p><p>When applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a mandatory set of security policies that users and systems in the Resource Zone should comply with, to be permitted to operate within the Zone. Typically, the organisation has mechanisms to verify that the systems are compliant to the mandatory set of policies (systems are patched, have anti-virus software with latest update, username and password are as per security policy etc) before they are permitted to access other Resource Zones.</p><p>When applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a mandatory set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, these well-defined network security policies are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider.</p><p>Applicable to:</p><p>Internal users and systems of the organisation connecting through the organisation’s Intranet, which may be managed by the organisation itself or by trusted network connectivity providers.</p><p>Users and systems of different Organizations connecting through trusted network, all of which are governed by a common set of security policies.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Organisation’s Intranet for its own users and systems.</p><p>INFINET, a Closed User Group network governed and secured by RBI.</p><h4 id=enhanced-trust-zone>Enhanced Trust Zone</h4><p>Characteristics:</p><p>When applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines an enhanced set of security policies that users and systems in this Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. Typically, the users and systems are in a Closed User Group (CUG) with extended control and monitoring of their activities.</p><p>When applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines an enhanced set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of highly secure VPNs and well-defined network security policies that are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider.</p><p>In general, the resource zones connected through an enhanced trust connectivity zone should themselves have enhanced trust.</p><p>Applicable to:</p><p>Internal users and systems of the organisation operating within Closed User Groups.</p><p>Users and systems of different Organizations connecting through trusted network, all of which are governed by a common set of enhanced security policies.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Organisation’s privileged users like system administrators managing the IT and OT resources.</p><p>Internal LANs for high security operations, systems, and network administration.</p><p>Some Government and Defence captive networks.</p><h4 id=high-trust-zone>High Trust Zone</h4><p>Characteristics:</p><p>When applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a maximal set of security policies that users and systems in this Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. The organisation also specifies physical security and access controls for this zone and usually enforces network airgap for high security. All activities in this zone are monitored closely for any policy violation.</p><p>When applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines an enhanced set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of highly secure VPNs and well-defined network security policies that are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider. Data diodes may be used for one-way communication from/to lower trust zones.</p><p>In general, the resource zones connected through a high trust connectivity zone should themselves have high trust and vice versa.</p><p>Applicable to:</p><p>Internal high security users and systems of the organisation operating within Closed User Groups.</p><p>High security users and systems of different Organizations connecting through high trust network, all of which are governed by a common set of enhanced security policies.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Some Government and Defence Organizations’ high security operations.</p><p>High trust zones for ensuring the integrity and privacy of critical databases, such as Aadhaar demographic data, PKI infrastructure, HSMs etc.</p><h4 id=very-high-trust-zone>Very High Trust Zone</h4><p>Characteristics:</p><p>When applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a maximal set of security policies that users and systems in this Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. The organisation also specifies physical security and access controls for this zone and always enforces network airgap for high security. All activities in this zone are monitored closely for any policy violation.</p><p>When applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a maximal set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of custom hardware-based VPNs and detailed network security policies that are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider. Data diodes may be used for one-way communication from/to lower trust zones.</p><p>In general, the resource zones connected through a very high trust connectivity zone should themselves have very high trust and vice versa.</p><p>Applicable to:</p><p>Internal high security users and systems of the organisation operating within Closed User Groups.</p><p>High security users and systems of different Organizations connecting through high trust network, all of which are governed by a common set of enhanced security policies.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Government and Defence Organizations’ very high security operations.</p><p>Very High trust zones for ensuring the integrity and privacy of extremely critical databases, such as Aadhaar biometric data, CCA and CA root certificates etc.</p><h3 id=using-trust-level-tags>Using Trust Level Tags</h3><p>The trust levels can be applied to various tags so as to establish a common understanding between different teams and organisational hierarchies.

This category is reserved for nation’s closest secrets and is to be used with great reserve.</li><li><strong>Secret</strong>: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security or national interest or cause serious embarrassment in its functioning. This classification should be used for highly important information and is the highest classification normally used.</li><li><strong>Confidential</strong>: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause damage to the security of the organisation or could be prejudicial to the interest of the organisation or could affect the organisation in its functioning. Most information, on proper analysis, will be classified no higher than confidential.</li><li><strong>Restricted</strong>: Information, which is essentially meant for official use only and which would not be published or communicated to anyone except for official purpose.</li><li><strong>Unclassified</strong>: Information that requires no protection against disclosure. e.g. public releases.</li></ul><p>Government organisations may want to establish a standardised mechanism to map classification tags to trust levels of resource and connectivity zones in government IT infrastructure.
