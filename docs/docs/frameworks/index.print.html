Framework</h1><p>Enterprise Architecture is a discipline that provides a holistic and integrated view of an organisation’s strategy, processes, information, and technology. This enterprise approach enables the alignment of various components of the business to work cohesively towards common goals. Within the Enterprise Architecture Framework, ‘enterprise’ can be understood in two key contexts:</p><ul><li>The broad spectrum of the enterprise, inclusive of all people, processes, and technology</li><li>A particular domain within the enterprise, such as a specific business unit or functional area.</li></ul><p>In both scenarios, the architecture spans multiple of systems and encompasses numerous departments within the organisation. When the objective is to create a cohesive network that includes the extended enterprise, it involves not only the internal divisions but also external entities such as partners, suppliers, and customers.</p><p>The aim of enterprise architecture as a framework is to optimise the often-fragmented legacy of processes across the enterprise (both manual and automated) into an integrated and secure environment that is responsive to changes and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy.</p><p>This section provides a reference framework to governing bodies and top management of regulated and critical sector entities to establish ‘due diligence’ on the use of IT in their respective entities. It describes the Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) at two levels, viz:</p><ul><li>Enterprise Business Architecture Framework (EBAF).</li><li>Enterprise Technology Architecture Framework (ETAF).</li></ul><p>The business architecture context is about how the organisation delivers value to its stakeholders. The technology architecture frameworks are about using technology to support the business mission, goals, objectives, and functions.</p><h3 id=enterprise-business-architecture-framework>Enterprise Business Architecture Framework</h3><h4 id=overview>Overview</h4><p>The Enterprise Business Architecture Framework (EBAF) presents an end-to-end methodology that strategically aligns an organisation&rsquo;s goals with its operational activities. Serving as an architectural blueprint, it guides leaders in shaping the processes, systems, and data flows central to the enterprise&rsquo;s functioning. By integrating various components of business—ranging from customer interactions to technological infrastructure—EBAF aims to create an environment that is both streamlined and agile, fostering a business structure that is efficient and swiftly responsive to evolving demands.</p><p>At its core, the purpose of EBAF is to provide a structured yet flexible means for articulating and implementing a business’s architecture that resonates with its strategic imperatives. This involves offering clear guidance for continuous improvement of operational processes, aligning every business move with strategic goals. Beyond merely enhancing operational effectiveness, the framework serves as a catalyst to reduce process redundancies and drive enterprise-wide efficiency, ensuring that all actions taken are deliberate and goal-oriented.</p><p>Incorporating a strong emphasis on security, EBAF also propels organisations to proactively address potential risks and integrate robust security measures into their business architecture. This security-minded approach is essential in safeguarding critical information and systems, ensuring resilience against threats, and maintaining trust with stakeholders. To reinforce business resilience and foster innovation, EBAF pursuits with compliance and governance, permitting the safe exploration of new technologies and practices within a secure architectural landscape. Effectively, EBAF not only ensures that organisations meet regulatory requirements but also establish a secure foundation for growth and transformation.</p><h4 id=the-business-ecosystem>The Business Ecosystem</h4><p>The business ecosystem of an entity describes its environment in terms of its functions and activities in relation to and with the participation of other entities and national bodies. The business ecosystem of an entity can also be described in terms of the use of IT in the provisioning and consumption of business services, the underlying business processes and information flows between the entity and its users, customers, partners, service providers and national bodies.</p><p>Business ecosystem of regulated and critical sector entities in Indian context is pictorially shown <a href=/docs/ecosystem/context/index.html#federated_digital_ecosystem>here</a>.</p><h3 id=enterprise-technology-architecture-framework>Enterprise Technology Architecture Framework</h3><p>The federated digital ecosystem of a CSE is manifested through an information infrastructure that runs the business, industrial and operational processes. Most of the currently available technical literature and knowledge focuses on differentiating the characteristics and technical architectures of IT, OT, IIoT and Information Security systems and networks. In contrast, this documentation attempts to synergise and harmonise the differentiated concepts and frameworks into a common representation that can help in better communication amongst the business, non-technical and technical stakeholders, both within and outside the organisations.</p><p>The enterprise technology architecture framework outlined in this section offers a unified reference for top and senior management of organisations and national nodal bodies. It is designed to facilitate informed decision-making on leveraging technology to achieve desired business results, establish best practices, and provide comprehensive guidance on functional, performance, operational, managerial, and security considerations. It may be noted that the word “technology” here refers specifically to IT, OT, and Information Security related technology, as well as IIoT technology used for physical access control and monitoring (e.g., smart cards, biometrics, CCTVs etc).</p><h4 id=concepts>Concepts</h4><h5 id=requirements-for-use-of-technology>Requirements for use of Technology</h5><p>The enterprise technology architecture framework of organisations should address the following requirements so that IT and OT are used efficiently, effectively, safely and securely:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Functional</strong>: Deliver the business and industrial objectives through functions, processes, operations, and services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quality</strong>: Deliver the required quality of systems and software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Deliver required performance of the functions and processes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>: Assurance that the functionality is implemented and configured correctly and is operating as intended.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: There are no weaknesses and vulnerabilities in hardware/ firmware/ software that could be exploited by malicious actors to cause harm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: The information and data are handled as per its security classification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>: The data and processes are trustable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: The functions and performance are available to the users at required levels of availability. </p></li><li><p><strong>Safety</strong>: Specific to OT and IIoT, the assurance that the operational processes are safe for humans and the environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Privacy of individuals and organisations is maintained, with regard to sensitive and private information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supply chain</strong>: Assurance that the entire supply chain is secure and not exploitable for causing harm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Management</strong>: People, process, and technology governance, which oversees and assures that the above parameters are consistently achieved throughout the life cycle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ecosystem</strong>: The organisation&rsquo;s digital infrastructure does not cause harm to other organisations that are part of the federated digital ecosystem.</p></li></ul><h5 id=architectural-principles>Architectural Principles</h5><p>The IT, OT and IS infrastructure implementation is based upon a common set of engineering and architectural principles, namely:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Zoning of assets, network, and resources (security by design, security in implementation).</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-layered security</strong>: Implementing a layered security cover to achieve defence in depth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Ability to assure a required level of functionality and performance in normal circumstances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>: Ability to deliver a minimum level of functionality and performance in the face of adversity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Ability to prevent the degradation of functions, performance, and trustworthiness; ability to minimise the impact of degradation (if it occurs) and ability to quickly recover from a degraded condition to the normal condition.</p></li></ul><h5 id=patterns-of-a-cses-information-infrastructure>Patterns of a CSE’s Information Infrastructure</h5><p>Almost all CSEs implement their information (IT, OT and IS) infrastructure through separate projects. Typical elements of an CSE’s information infrastructure, its operation, management, and use are described below:</p><ul><li><p>A common information infrastructure across the entity, whose elements include hardware and software (end-user devices, mail, web, and portal servers), network and security systems, and information services (email, portal, common user applications, databases etc). The in-store and in-use assets are usually managed through ERP/ ITAM/ ITOM/ CMDB platforms.</p></li><li><p>The common information infrastructure is managed through pan-organisation IT Operations/ Service management (ITOM/ ITSM) and Information Security management systems (ISMS).</p></li><li><p>The platforms have their own IT infrastructure, viz, devices and runtime platforms to carry out IT and IS management functions related to asset configurations, availability and performance, patches and upgrades, compliance to hardening baselines, identity and access, authentication and authorisation, systems and network management, security management, logs and audit trails (evidence management), vulnerability and compliance management, security incident and event management (SIEM), incident response management, (IR, EDR/ XDR, SOAR), analytics etc. </p></li><li><p>Devices, systems, platforms, networks, security, applications, and databases of critical processes are usually segregated into secure logical or physical (air-gapped) high-trust zones.</p></li><li><p>Air-gapped high-trust zones would typically have their own management systems, while non-air-gapped high-trust zones may be managed through the pan-organisation management systems.</p></li><li><p>Integration of the security related components of physical infrastructure, viz physical access control (biometrics and smart cards), physical surveillance (CCTV networks) and management of critical non-IT asset dependencies (BIMS, UPS, Generators etc) of data centres.</p></li><li><p>Workforce required to operate, manage, and secure the information infrastructure.</p></li><li><p>Users, both humans and machines, who access the information infrastructure for i) consuming services, ii) carrying out system administration and management, or iii) providing service, such as technical support or customer service.</p></li></ul><p>A generic deployment is pictorially represented below. It depicts the computer resources and management/ operational platforms of an entity’s IT/ OT/ IIoT infrastructure. The terms ‘non-critical’ and ‘critical’ are only indicative of how entities classify their processes and thereby, the underlying IT/ OT/ IIoT infrastructure of the processes.</p><p><a href=#R-image-b2b0b78819c89b3d354ce7aea4e00e47 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Enterprise IT deployment view" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/frameworks/architecture/enterprise_IT_deployment_view.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

It corresponds to the term “Computer Resource” in the IT Act 2000 (revised 2008).</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Centre premises</strong>: a generic term to describe a geographical site, which hosts the computing, storage, internal networking, and other resources that an entity uses to deliver business services and carry out its business functions and operations. Server rooms are equivalent to micro data centres.</p></li><li><p><strong>User premises</strong>: a generic term to describe a geographical site, which hosts the computing, storage, internal networking, and other resources that are used by users (human and machine) to connect to the data centres to access services. Users may be consumers of service, systems administrators, or providers of service. The providers of service include technical support and customer service teams etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Centre constituents</strong>: a generic term to describe the different constituents of a typical data centre, such as the property on which the data centre is built, the data centre facility, non-IT and IT constituents within the data centre and connectivity from/to the data centre. Typically, each of the constituents are evaluated when strategic decisions are taken regarding the data centres.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Infrastructure Resources</strong>: the <strong>in-use</strong> network infrastructure resources can be described on the basis of the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>Communication media: copper, optical fibre (OFC), power line carrier communication (PLCC), Optical Power Ground Wire (OPGW) on power transmission lines, HF/ VHF/ UHF, microwave, and satellite links.</li></ul><p>- WAN communication protocols: PDH, SONET/ SDH, Metro Ethernet, xDSL, AON/PON, MPLS, IP, power sector communication protocols like IEC 60870 and 61850 series/ DNP/ Modbus/ RTU, OSGP, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), GPRS, 4G, 5G.</p><ul><li><p>Network topologies: point to point, point to multipoint star, mesh, or bus topology.</p></li><li><p>Network device functions: transmission, switching, routing, element and network management, network security etc.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Network Provider infrastructure</strong>: a generic term to describe one or many geographical sites, which hosts the network infrastructure resources that lies outside of the data centre and user premises. The network infrastructure is owned by a network provider entity (TSP, ISP). The data centre and user premises use customer premises equipment (CPEs) to connect to the network provider infrastructure. The CPEs themselves may be customer-owned or provider-owned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zone</strong>: a generic term zone is defined as a grouping of logical or physical assets that share common security requirements based on factors such as criticality and consequence. This definition has been generalised in this document to describe groups of in-use IT, OT and IS resources within data centre or user premises, the physical or logical grouping being done as per functional, operational, management or security requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perimeter</strong>: a physical or logical boundary wall between two zones, which also has access controls (gates) for ingress into and egress out of the zones. Physical access control is relevant for premises, while logical access controls are relevant for systems and networks.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Conduit</strong>: a generic term conduit is defined as grouping of assets dedicated exclusively to communications and which share the same security requirements. In this document it describes the communication channels connecting the zones and also the tunnels through the perimeter that separates two zones. Examples of the latter are VPN tunnels and data diode.</p></li></ul><h4 id=ontology-of-tags-for-enterprise-information-infrastructure>Ontology of Tags for Enterprise Information Infrastructure</h4><p>Governing bodies, top and senior management and the technical heads in entities are provided with a common vocabulary to represent the use of IT within the entity. The <a href=/docs/frameworks/ontology/index.html>ontology for tagging an enterprise’s information infrastructure</a> has three tag-groups, viz <strong>resource categorisation tag group</strong>, <strong>hierarchical level tag group</strong> and <strong>trust level tag group</strong>.</p><p>The ontology is technologically agnostic so that it can understood by both business and technical persons. The tags are meant to be used in architecture diagrams and presentations of business and technical management to describe the use of IT, both for their internal decision processes and for communication with external entities. The tagging enables non-technical personnel to assimilate the context and participate in decision-making.</p><h5 id=resource-categorisation-tags>Resource Categorisation Tags</h5><p>The resource categorisation tags help the stakeholders to represent the ownership and control that an entity has over its information infrastructure elements. The following tags are in this group:</p><ol><li>Resource zones - central (S) or end-user (U).</li><li>In-use resources purpose and use – functional (FS, FU) or governance/ management/ administration (GS, GU).</li><li>Connectivity zones (V).</li><li>Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD).</li><li>Connectivity ownership (VA, VB, VC, VD).</li><li>Connectivity purpose and use (XA, XB, XC, XD).</li><li>End user resource ownership (UA, UB, UC, UD).</li><li>End user role (NU, OU).</li><li>Control over human workforce (WA, WB, WC, WD).</li><li>Services (DC, IS, OS, TS, SS, FM).</li><li>Service ownership (JA, JB, JC, JD).</li><li>Data centre segmentation (ML1 to ML4).</li><li>Cloud services segmentation (YL0 to YL4)</li></ol><h5 id=sample-use-case-for-resource-categorization-tags>Sample Use Case for Resource Categorization Tags</h5><p><strong>Scenario</strong>:</p><p>A CSE wants to implement a new Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) to streamline its IT infrastructure, operations, and governance.</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>:</p><p>The organisation&rsquo;s resources are diverse and distributed across various departments, zones, and functions. The complexity of managing these resources often leads to inefficiencies, lack of clarity in ownership, and difficulty in governance. There is an immediate need for a system that can simplify the categorisation and understanding of these resources for all relevant stakeholders, while also supporting the implementation of the new EAF.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>To address this challenge, the organisation decides to employ a set of resource categorization tags within their EAF. These tags act as labels that allow for easy identification and categorisation of resources, helping stakeholders to better understand the purpose, ownership, governance and threat modelling of each resource within the enterprise infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Resource Zones Tags:</strong> Tags like ‘Central (S)&rsquo; for shared resources and &lsquo;End-User (U)&rsquo; for individual user-specific resources simplify the location and accessibility of resource classification for stakeholders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose and Use Tags:</strong> Tags such as &lsquo;functional (FS, FU)&rsquo; for operational resources and &lsquo;governance/management/administration (GS, GU)&rsquo; for resources related to the oversight and control efficiently distinguish between the functional aspects of resources and their governance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connectivity and Ownership Tags:</strong> Tags like &lsquo;Connectivity zones (V)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD)&rsquo; offer clarity on the connective infrastructure and its proprietors, expediting responsibility allocation and incident resolution.

Appropriate trust levels can be assigned to the zones. This will help the project design and engineering teams, procurement, and provisioning teams, IT and information security operations management teams and the service providers in better risk analysis and allocation of various resources. The following tags are in this group:</p><ol><li>Central resource hierarchy of zones (HL0 to HL5).</li><li>Perimeter zones between hierarchical zones (PHL1 to PHL4.5).</li><li>Perimeter zones in data centre segments (PM1 to PM4).</li><li>Perimeter zones in cloud environment (PYL0 to PYL4).</li></ol><h5 id=sample-use-case-for-hierarchical-level-tags>Sample Use Case for Hierarchical Level Tags</h5><p><strong>Scenario</strong>:</p><p>An organisation is in the process of adopting a new Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) to bolster its IT and OT infrastructure&rsquo;s efficiency, security, and governance. A key challenge they face in this deployment is managing the complexity and diversity of their information infrastructure, which includes various hierarchical zones, data centre segments, and cloud environments.</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>:</p><p>Project design and engineering teams, alongside procurement, provisioning, IT and OT operations management, and service providers, struggle with conducting effective risk analysis and resource allocation due to the intricate nature of the infrastructure layout and the varying levels of trust associated with each zone. The IT and OT teams must also be able to converge onto a common representation of their respective hierarchies.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>In addressing these challenges, the organisation opts to implement hierarchical level tags within their EAF. These tags help to classify the information infrastructure into hierarchical zones with assigned trust levels. This tagging enables the stakeholders to clearly segment the IT and OT resources, aiding in threat modelling, risk analysis and the strategic allocation of resources across zones.</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Central Resource Hierarchy Tags:</strong> Tags ranging from ‘Central resource hierarchy of zones (HL0 to HL5)&rsquo; clearly delineate the core infrastructure zones, establishing a graded structure of trust and access controls that escalate with each hierarchy level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perimeter Zone Tags:</strong> &lsquo;Perimeter zones between hierarchical zones (PHL1 to PHL4.5)&rsquo; tags facilitate a distinct border identification between hierarchical zones, serving as checkpoints for security assessments and transitions in trust levels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Centre and Cloud Perimeter Tags:</strong> Tags like &lsquo;perimeter zones in data centre segments (PM1 to PM4)&rsquo; and &lsquo;perimeter zones in cloud environment (PYL0 to PYL4)&rsquo; categorize resources within data centres and cloud segments. These tags help stakeholder teams evaluate and address specific security concerns more accurately within these venues based on the designated trust levels.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Improved Risk Management:</strong> Hierarchical tags aid in identifying and managing potential risks associated with the varying zones, thus enhancing the overall security posture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlined Resource Deployment:</strong> The tags create an organized structure that simplifies the understanding of where resources reside and their respective trust levels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Informed Decision-Making:</strong> Teams gain insights into infrastructure vulnerabilities and strengths, enabling them to make more strategic decisions about resource deployment and protection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Effective Collaboration:</strong> A common classification system assists diverse teams in synchronizing their efforts, thus facilitating collaboration, and reducing inconsistencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Security Profiles:</strong> Each resource carries a clear security profile through tagging, accommodating tailored security measures.</p></li></ul><p>An illustrative use of resource categorisation tags is given below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-d2dddc1fc70beb67720a6f81afeb2c19 class=lightbox-link><img alt=use_of_hierarchical_level_tags_for_IT class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/frameworks/architecture/use_of_hierarchical_level_tags_for_IT.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

This will help the project design and engineering teams, IT and information security operations management teams and the service providers to design, implement, operate and manage zoning, segmentation and zero trust architecture. The following tags are in this group:</p><p>‒         Trust level (TL0 to TL5)</p><h5 id=sampe-use-case-for-trust-level-tags>Sampe Use Case for Trust Level Tags</h5><p><strong>Overview</strong>:</p><p>An organization plans to implement zero trust in its enterprise IT. Stakeholders include IT architects, security officers, network administrators, and management teams who must understand and enforce the security policies, zoning and segmentation within the organization&rsquo;s operations effectively.</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>:</p><p>Varied levels of data sensitivity and diverse IT systems across the enterprise create a complex security landscape that requires a clear and uniform approach to managing trust and control levels. Stakeholders require a reliable method for identifying, at a glance, the security trust levels and enforcement strength for each zone to correctly implement and adhere to security policies, controls, and compliance requirements.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>Trust level tags serve as a simple and effective way to categorise and label the components of the organisation&rsquo;s resource and connectivity zones based on defined security policies and the level of control the entity has or requires. These tags help stakeholders instantly recognise the importance and sensitivity of each zone, ultimately guiding their risk management and policy enforcement actions.</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Defining Trust Levels:</strong> Categorise and define security trust levels ranging from TL0 to TL5. Establish criteria for each level based on the level of control the entity has/ can have over the zone</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluating and Tagging Resource Zones:</strong> Assess each resource zone within the organisation and determine the appropriate trust level. Apply the respective trust level tag to systems, databases, and networks accordingly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluating and Tagging Connectivity Zones:</strong> Analyse network segments and connectivity frameworks for security enforcement capability and requirements. Assign trust level tags that match their security policy framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>Incorporating into EAF documentation:</strong> Update all related architecture diagrams, policies, and procedural documents with the applied trust level tags to create a standard reference across the organisation, ensuring coherence and mutual understanding among all stakeholders responsible for zero trust.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enhanced Risk Management:</strong> Trust levels guide stakeholders toward adequately securing each zone according to its criticality and the organization&rsquo;s risk tolerance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> The standardized tagging system reduces complexity and eases the communication of security and compliance statuses across departments and teams.</p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlined Policy Enforcement:</strong> Clearly identified trust levels support consistent application of security measures and rapid adjustment to evolving threats.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficient Compliance Monitoring:</strong> Tags make it easier to monitor adherence to internal and external compliance standards, enabling swift corrective measures as needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimized Security Investments:</strong> By identifying zones with higher trust levels, the organization can prioritize security investments and focus resources where they are most impactful.</p></li></ul><p><a href=#R-image-52bf85d6fc1529e10e24ae35388d4dcc class=lightbox-link><img alt=use_of_trust_level_tags class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/frameworks/architecture/use_of_trust_level_tags.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The use of IT to transform business functions is usually initiated through Detailed Project Reports (DPR) for new IT projects, which are then executed through one of more RFPs. A study of various DPRs indicate that they reflect the strategic direction of the organisations in the use of IT and cover a period of 7 to 10 years. The following aspects of strategic direction are usually recorded in the DPRs:</p><ul><li><p>Mission, functions, business capabilities and business processes of the organisation.</p></li><li><p>External context – other organizations with whom IT-driven interaction is carried out.</p></li><li><p>Internal context – organisational hierarchy and structure, sites and locations, line, staff and functional units, roles and responsibilities of departments and key personnel.</p></li><li><p>Current state of use of IT and information security to support the business functions.</p></li><li><p>Expectations from the use of IT in terms of enhancement of capabilities, efficiency, and effectiveness in carrying out the business functions.</p></li><li><p>Expected or desired future state of use of IT and information security.</p></li></ul><p>The DPR process can thus be effectively used by the Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning Group within entities to design a common entity-wide business architecture framework that is independently managed and maintained by the teams. This framework can then be used as a common reference in all IT, OT and IS projects, covering both transformational and incremental enhancement projects.</p><p>It is pertinent to note that business partners are now extensively connected to enterprise IT systems, for a wide range of functionality of business processes. Not only can business partners create liability for organizations, but they can also be the source of adversarial or negligent cyber threats. This aspect needs to be considered while defining the stakeholder responsibilities in the enterprise business architecture.</p><h4 id=enterprise-technology-architecture-framework-1>Enterprise Technology Architecture Framework</h4><p>The regulated and critical sector entities use a wide variety of methods to depict and describe their enterprise IT, OT and IS architectures. However, there is no commonality regarding this aspect among the CSEs of different sectors.</p><p>The tagging methodology provides a common ontology for business and technical managers. Each tag expresses a distinct characteristic or feature of the architectural element that can help the top management to evaluate the impact, risk, compliance, governance, security, monitoring, and oversight aspects of that particular element of the architecture. A combined view of all the evaluations can help the top management to decide and direct the most appropriate use of IT.</p><p>The business and operation levels of the entity hierarchy can further use the tagging ontology to evaluate, decide, design, procure, implement, deploy, operate, manage, support, and monitor the IT, OT and IS resources over their operating lifecycle. The ontology would help the business, IT and IS heads to arrive at a common understanding on the prioritisation for investments into the use of IT.</p><p>The common ontology would also help the Government ministries, regulators, and national nodal bodies to focus their policies, regulations, oversight, and monitoring mechanisms on the vital components of the enterprise architecture.</p><h4 id=strategic-decisions>Strategic Decisions</h4><p>The EBAF and ETAF provide useful guidance to the Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning Group to evaluate and monitor the use of IT and IS in the business context of the entity, and also advise the top management on providing the required strategic direction.

These zones are tagged as System or <strong>‘S’ zones</strong>.</p><p><strong>End User Resource Zones (U Zones):</strong> These zones host the in-use operating resources (computing devices, applications, data repositories) of end users and their local networking and security infrastructure. The users may be human or machine and are typically identified by their credentials (user and machine ids) that are linked to centrally managed user and system accounts. The user zones are generally located physically within the office premises of organisations or work/ home premises of remote users. These zones are tagged as User or <strong>‘U’ zones</strong>.</p><h3 id=in-use-resources>In-Use Resources</h3><p>Computer resources (assets) of entities may lie in the store or be deployed for use.

For example, the risk of non-compliance of data localisation requirement is higher in the case of Type SD as compared to Type SC.</p><p><strong>Tag SA</strong> entity owned private cloud is exclusive to the organisation, which may be hosted on-premises or in a site hired from a property owner. This corresponds to the pattern where an organisation provides its own captive cloud services.</p><p><strong>Tag SB</strong> GOE owned cloud is typically mandated for almost all the critical business functions of CSEs. Many common services like email, portals, eOffice and other IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS/ DRaaS are provided as cloud services to the Govt Community.</p><p><strong>Tag SC</strong> private cloud service providers with India-only data centres are easily able to comply with data localisation requirements that can be verified using lower levels of audit effort. Such CSP data centres are preferable when data localisation requirement as well as control over data storage outside of India is of high priority.</p><p><strong>Tag SD</strong> private cloud service providers with multi-country data centres include the i) the likes of global CSPs like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle, SAP; ii) OEM service management related to OEM patches, vulnerability feeds and sending system telemetry back to the OEMs, specifically relevant to OT OEM support services that are provided from OEM support cloud installations.; iii) third-party managed services (MSPs and MSSPs) covering both Indian and non-Indian ownership and control; iv) content delivery network (CDN) providers; v) domain name providers, digital certificate issuers, PKI management providers like DigiCert, DNS and other security service providers like Cloudflare etc.</p><p>The key advantages of tag SD CSPs are that they can provide very high levels of infrastructure scaling, availability, and business continuity. A large pool of trained and experienced professionals is also available for such CSPs, and these professionals can be easily hired to manage and secure the zones implemented in these CSP data centres. These CSPs can comply with data residency within the Indian geography but cannot easily prove compliance that data is not also residing outside of India. Significant audit effort is required to verify the same. Hence, such CSP data centres are relevant when an organisation requires very high and dynamic scalability or has to provide its services beyond the national boundaries or when there are no major concerns related to copies of data being stored outside of India.</p><h3 id=connectivity-ownership>Connectivity Ownership</h3><p>These zones host the Wide Area Network (WAN) network provider infrastructure that provide the conduits for voice, video, and data connectivity between the resource zones.

The organisation can enforce that the end-user devices must have adequate endpoint protection (AV, anti-malware etc) and comply with organisational policies (patches/ updates, upgrades, password policy enforcement, authorised applications, VPN usage etc). These controls can even be enforced and centrally managed on the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) of remote workers.</p><p>Entities have a lower level of control over tag UB, UC resources that belong to other Organizations. In most cases, the user’s organisation is responsible for configuring, securing, and managing the end user resources. Other organisation’s users (humans and machines) typically connect to one’s own organisation’s information infrastructure through the Extranet. Other organisation users may also connect using IPSEC or SSL VPNs over the Internet. One’s own organisation must depend upon the other organisation’s policies and processes of control over the end-user devices in terms of their endpoint protection and compliance to policies. Formal and established relationships between entities help to increase the trust in the human users and machines of the other entities.</p><p>Entities do not have any control over tag UD resources, the end-user devices of public users, who connect to organisation’s information infrastructure through the Internet, typically using browser or mobile applications. Machine to machine connections from public users/ Organizations to an organisation’s systems are generally API-based.</p><h3 id=end-user-role>End User Role</h3><p>The end user resources are categorised as under, based on the role of the human user or machine.

This is done by the organisation themselves for resource categories WA and WB or by the service provider for resource categories WC and WD. Some Organizations also invest into the technical skill development of their WB resources (contractual employees).</p><p>The administrative functions related to the workforce covers aspects of skill verification and documentation during workforce onboarding, contract management, compliance to laws and regulation. This is done by the organisation itself for its own employees under resource category WA or by the resource/ service provider for resource categories WB, WC, and WD. Some Organizations manage the compensation payments and payment of GST for resource categories WB by themselves, while others let the workforce resource provider do the same.</p><p>The physical and IT access control of the workforce covers aspects of physical entry into the organisation’s premises and places of work within the organisation. It also covers access to IT and OT resources, both on-premises and remotely through the network. All Organizations control the physical access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC. The Organizations also control the IT access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC when they are on the organisation’s premises. In case of remote working of WC and WD category workforce, the service providers decide which person is assigned to remotely manage their customer organisation’s IT / OT infrastructure and further controls the IT access of the assigned resource as per the SLAs signed with the customer organisation.</p><p>The above workforce control categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate and provide strategic direction on the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of i) the workforce employed to operate and manage their central resources in data centres, and ii) the workforce employed by their outsourced and managed service providers (WC and WD).</p><p>For example, the risk of data leakage is higher from those providers of outsourced and managed services (WC, WD), who do not have good due diligence processes to hire, train and monitor their own and contractual employees, or they are further outsourcing the work to second tier service providers. Due diligence is especially important for workforce having privileged user (OU) rights.</p><p>A strategic assessment of the level of control available to an entity with regard to the outsourced workforce (WC and WD) operating and managing its resource and connectivity zones would help the entity identify the SLAs that should be in place with the outsourced and managed service providers. The SLAs should especially cover the control, monitoring, and oversight on the privileged users (OU) of the service providers since these highly skilled users generally work remotely.</p><h3 id=service-ownership>Service Ownership</h3><p>The modern federated digital ecosystem is largely driven by services. In general, a Service Provider Entity (<strong>SPE</strong>) delivers a service to a Customer Entity (<strong>CE)</strong>, who acquires the service.

IS/ISO/IEC 27017:2015 provides guidelines on information security controls suitable for cloud services provision and usage, that can provide guidance to the DC-SPE and the CE. The DC-SPEs also obtain certification of compliance to various standards that are applicable to cloud services, such as IS/ISO/IEC 20000-1, SOC-2 etc. These standards are described in the compendium.</p><p>As per industry practice, the resource provisioning and orchestration functions are carried out by the DC-SPE. However, the responsibility of operation, management and security of customer subscribed data centre resources is shared between the DC-SPE and CE based on the type of cloud computing model that the CE has subscribed to from the DC-SPE. These are broadly classified into IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, XaaS etc. NIST SP 800-145, SP 500-292, and SP 500-332 provide detail guidance on cloud computing models.</p><h3 id=segmentation-of-cloud-services>Segmentation of Cloud Services</h3><p>The cloud computing resource types given in the table below are adapted from the industry practice in a manner that it can also be applied to entity-owned captive data centres and GOE owned data centres.

The organisation cannot enforce security policies on the users and systems. Neither the organisation nor the ISP can enforce any security policies for network traffic that passes through the public network.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Public users anonymously accessing an organisation’s website over the Internet or mobile network.</p><h4 id=low-trust-zone>Low Trust Zone</h4><p>Characteristics:</p><p>When applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a minimal set of security policies that users and systems in the Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. Typically, no anonymous access is provided, and all users and systems must be registered with an organisation, using their username & password or allocated API secret.</p><p>When applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of VPNs controlled by the organisation or a trustworthy network connectivity provider, who has well defined network security policies for the Connectivity Zone.</p><p>Applicable to:</p><p>External users and systems that can connect to an organisation’s zone after pre-registration and through session-based authentication, they are also required to use browser-based (https) or client-based VPNs, which are controlled by the organisation and governed by the organisation’s security policies.</p><p>External users and systems of other Organizations connecting through trusted extranet connectivity providers.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Public users connecting to an organisation’s website through the Internet or mobile network using a browser or app-based SSL VPN and further logging into their user account before doing any further activity.</p><p>Applications on the devices of public users and Organizations, which connect to an organisation’s API gateways by using registered API secrets.</p><p>NICNET and NKN based extranets that provide network interconnectivity between different Organizations.

The organisation also specifies physical security and access controls for this zone and always enforces network airgap for high security. All activities in this zone are monitored closely for any policy violation.</p><p>When applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a maximal set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of custom hardware-based VPNs and detailed network security policies that are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider.

Principally, the models must be able to provide insights to some of the concerns of CSEs and national bodies, as listed below:</p><ul><li><p>What are the maturity levels of CSEs in comparison with established benchmarks in governance, risk management, enterprise architectures, system lifecycle management, IT and infosec capabilities, technology implementations, operations and support processes, workforce characteristics?</p></li><li><p>What must be improved?</p></li><li><p>What needs to be measured and assessed to enable improvement?</p></li><li><p>How comprehensive are the enterprise policies, practices and processes?</p></li><li><p>How good is the visibility, oversight, and control across the enterprise on the compliance to policies?</p></li></ul><p>In general, CMMs have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li><p>collect the best practices.</p></li><li><p>are developed by a collaboration of experts from diverse backgrounds.</p></li><li><p>consider the dispersion in size, knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience of organisations that use the model.</p></li><li><p>take a life cycle and continuous improvement approach.</p></li></ul><p>There are prominent capability maturity models in the domains of cybersecurity and SOC operations, which are described below.</p><h3 id=capability-maturity-modelling-cybercmm>Capability Maturity Modelling (CyberCMM)</h3><p>Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Modelling (CyberCMM) is globally acknowledged as a practical and successful approach to measure and improve the cyber resilience of enterprises. It helps organisations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make improvements to their cybersecurity programs. It focuses on the implementation and management of cyber security practices associated with the information technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) assets and the environments in which they operate. A CyberCMM can:</p><ul><li><p>enable organisations to evaluate and benchmark their cybersecurity capabilities effectively and consistently and prioritize actions and investments to improve their cybersecurity capabilities.</p></li><li><p>enable national bodies to share knowledge, best practices, and relevant references across organisations to help them improve their cybersecurity capabilities.</p></li><li><p>enable national bodies to carry out data-driven analytics from sectoral, cross-sectoral and trends-over-time perspectives.</p></li></ul><p>Cybersecurity capability maturity models are typically designed and engineered to provide a self- assessment platform for individual CSEs.

The cybersecurity capabilities of DIB organisations can be rigorously measured using CMMC. This can be used by the DoD to make risk-informed decisions regarding the information it shares with DIB contractors. The CMMC thus helps the DOD in establishing levels of confidenece with regard to the security of defense contractors and the DIB.</p><p>The CMMC framework draws on maturity processes and cybersecurity best practices from multiple standards as well as input from DIB entities and the DoD. It is primarily designed to secure the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) supply chain. The DIB organisations have to be certified by a CMMC third-party assessment organisation (C3PAO) at a particular level prior to bidding on contracts.</p><p>The CMMC defines the following:</p><ul><li><p>a <strong>practice</strong> is a specific technical activity or activities that are required and performed to achieve a specific level of cybersecurity maturity for a given capability in a domain.</p></li><li><p>a <strong>process</strong> is a specific procedural activity that is required and performed to achieve a maturity level.</p></li></ul><p>CMMC version 2.0 Dec 2021 defines 14 domains, three levels with practices for each level for the DIB, as under:</p><ul><li><p>Level 1 – Foundational (level 1 of v1.0) - 17 practices 48 FAR 52-204-21 Oct 2016</p></li><li><p>Level 2 – Advanced (level 3 of v1.0) – mirrors NIST SP 800-171 (110 practices)</p></li><li><p>Level 3 – Expert (level 5 of v1.0) – based on subset of NIST SP 800-172.</p></li></ul><p>The 14 domains are aligned with the families specified in NIST SP 800-171</p><ul><li><p>Access Control (AC)</p></li><li><p>Awareness & Training (AT)</p></li><li><p>Audit & Accountability (AU)</p></li><li><p>Configuration Management (CM)</p></li><li><p>Identification & Authentication (IA)</p></li><li><p>Incident Response (IR)</p></li><li><p>Maintenance (MA)</p></li><li><p>Media Protection (MP)</p></li><li><p>Personnel Security (PS)</p></li><li><p>Physical Protection (PE)</p></li><li><p>Risk Assessment (RA)</p></li><li><p>Security Assessment (CA)</p></li><li><p>System & Comn Protection (SC)</p></li><li><p>System & Info Integrity (SI)</p></li></ul><p>An organisation must meet both the process and practice level requirements to achieve that level of certification within CMMC.</p><h4 id=iec-62443-maturity-levels>IEC 62443 Maturity Levels</h4><p>From an organisational perspective, the IEC 62443 standard series describes four “Maturity Level” ratings (ML 1 – ML 4). The ML rating system is used to evaluate how well an organisation defines and describes security processes and how well the processes are followed by the personnel involved. The maturity levels are distinct from security levels (SL-T).</p><h4 id=cert-resilience-management-model-cert-rmm>CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM)</h4><p>The CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM), developed by the CERT Division of SEI, Carnegie Mellon University defines 26 processes areas grouped into 4 categories - Enterprise Management, Operations Management, Engineering and Process Management. The resilience strategy translates to evolving measures to protect and sustain the assets viz. people, information, technology and facilities.</p><h4 id=rebit-cybersecurity-maturity-model-cmm>ReBIT Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMM)</h4><p>The RBI Cyber Security Maturity Model (CMM) is developed in Oct 2017 as an industry initiative coordinated by ReBIT. The CMM is closely aligned with RBI-CSF, which is harmonious with international standards, such as NIST CSF, COBIT 5.0, ISO 27000 and other standards.</p><p>RBI CMM focuses on i) implementation and adoption of the mandated cybersecurity framework uniformly in the financial firms, ii) understanding of the firm’s cybersecurity maturity in terms of the adoption of the regulatory cybersecurity framework, iii) benchmarking, and iv) regulatory tracking.</p><p>The CMM provides guidance through i) a methodical approach to measurement of risk, planning of controls and governance and security strategy execution to strengthen cybersecurity posture of financial firms, and ii) metrics-based treatment, benchmarking and prioritizing risk driven investment in security.</p><h4 id=secure-controls-frameworks-scf>Secure Controls Framework’s™ (SCF)</h4><p>SCF&rsquo;s Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Capability Maturity Model (C|P-CMM) is an undertaking by SCF contributors to define maturity levels for the SCF’s control catalogue. The SCF leverages an existing framework, namely the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model v2.0 (SSE-CMM) and provides control-level criteria to an existing CMM model.</p><h3 id=soc-cmm>SOC-CMM</h3><p><a href=https://www.soc-cmm.com/ rel=external target=_blank>SOC-CMM</a>, evolved from a research project to become a well-used standard for measuring capability maturity in Security Operations Centres. The SOC-CMM model was initially created to determine characteristics and features of SOCs, such as specific technologies or processes. It evolved to become the defacto standard for measuring capability maturity in Security Operations Centers.</p><p>At the core of the assessment tool lies the SOC-CMM model. This model consists of 5 domains and 26 aspects, that are each evaluated using a number of questions. The domains &lsquo;Business&rsquo;, &lsquo;People&rsquo; and &lsquo;Process&rsquo; are evaluated for maturity only (blue colour), the domains &lsquo;Technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;Services&rsquo; are evaluated for both maturity and capability (purple colour).</p><h4 id=maturity>Maturity</h4><p>SOC-CMM is a continuous maturity model, allowing improvements across all domains simultaneously and independently. The SOC-CMM uses maturity stages based loosely on the CMMI:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Non-existent</strong>. At this level, the aspect is not present in the SOC</p></li><li><p><strong>Initial</strong>. The aspect is delivered in an ad-hoc fashion</p></li><li><p><strong>Managed</strong>. The aspect is documented and delivered consistently</p></li><li><p><strong>Defined</strong>. The aspect is managed using ad-hoc feedback on the quality and timeliness of deliverables</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantitatively Managed</strong>. The aspect is systematically being measured for quality, quantity and timeliness of deliverables</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimizing</strong>. The aspect is continuously being optimized and improved.</p></li></ul><h4 id=capability>Capability</h4><p>The SOC-CMM uses a continuous approach to measuring technical capability across the technology and services domains. These can be technical features, such as the existence of certain tooling options or other features such as service artefacts. Capabilities can be expressed at any maturity level. Just like with maturity scoring, capability scoring is continuous. Similar to the CMMI, the SOC-CMM supports 4 capability levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Incomplete</strong>. The capability is missing or lacking essential features</p></li><li><p><strong>Performed</strong>. The capability is performed, but not standardised</p></li><li><p><strong>Defined</strong>. The capability is deliverd in a standardised fashion</p></li><li><p><strong>Managed</strong>. The capability is active managed and improved.</p></li></ul><h4 id=methodology>Methodology</h4><p>The methodology used to create the SOC-CMM is a scientific research approach called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science_research rel=external target=_blank>Design Science Research</a>. This type of research has a focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice and works well for areas that have not been extensively (scientifically) studied and clearly defined, as is the case for SOC capability and maturity.

Any guidance that is based on IS, ISO, IEC, ITU-T standards provides the following advantages:</p><ul><li><p>These standards are maintained and regularly updated by an international panel of experts, which also has Indian participation.</p></li><li><p>The ISO standards can be easily extended to include any additional requirements, especially those that are defined under the Indian law and regulation, or available in global frameworks like NIST, CIS, CSA etc. </p></li><li><p>The standards can provide a common baseline reference amongst all the NCRF stakeholders, especially in the i) definition and usage of various terms, ii) governance, management, risk, compliance and audit frameworks, iii) implementation and continual improvement approaches, and iv) standardisation of processes related to verification, validation, measurement and audit. The common baseline reference will ensure that the possibility of misunderstanding amongst the stakeholders is minimal.</p></li><li><p>Entities can get their organisations certified against specific management standards. The entities can also procure and use the other guidance and technical standards to help them in maximising the effectiveness during implementation.</p></li><li><p>There will be synergy between the entities and their internal/ external experts, consultants, implementers and auditors, since everyone refers to the same set of standards. In practice, this is already being done with regard to popular standards such as ISO 9000, ISO 27000 and IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>The oversight mechanism of Government bodies, regulators and national nodal agencies is easily harmonised when all bodies adopt a commonly accepted set of standards.</p></li><li><p>There is already a large pool of consultants, implementers and auditors in India, who have the knowledge, expertise and experience in implementing and auditing entities based on these standards. Capacity building of this pool, both in terms of quantity of personnel and quality of expertise, can be taken up through various national and international forums.

Designed to enable standardised communication, these formats and protocols provide a common language for systems in industries such as cyber security, telecommunications, and IT, allowing for seamless automation processes across diverse platforms. Some of these relevant for cyber security are referred in subsequent paras with purpose and usage.</p><h4 id=stix>STIX</h4><p>Overview: To share CTI, it is imperative that the underlying platform converts the data into a form that is ready for being sent through the network. To that end a process is required to convert the data-object (a combination of code and data) in a form so that the state of the object is saved in a transmittable format. This is known as Serialization . Once the data is received at the destination in a Serialized form, it is Deserialized before further processing. STIX stands for Structured Threat Information Expression. It is an open source, XML based &ldquo;language and serialization format used to exchange&rdquo; CTI. STIX is a standardized language for representing and sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) in a consistent, machine-readable format. Developed by MITRE and now managed by OASIS, STIX enables organisations to share detailed threat information, including attack patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and threat actor profiles. The structured nature of STIX allows cybersecurity tools to process threat data automatically, enhancing detection, analysis, and response capabilities across systems</p><p>Purpose: Leveraging STIX, organisations can collaborate effectively while exchanging CTI because of the consistency and machine readability that STIX provides. Consequently, security communities benefit as anticipation to attacks improve and agility in response mechanisms is enhanced. Further, its design is such that it augments capabilities, such as &ldquo;collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response&rdquo; .</p><p>Usage: STIX at its core architectural layer contains &ldquo;observables&rdquo; that it refers to as &ldquo;stateful properties or measurable events&rdquo;, pertaining to the &ldquo;operation of computers and networks&rdquo;. For example, it could be stopping a service, reboot of a system or establishing a connection. Storage of these &ldquo;observables&rdquo; is done in XML using &ldquo;CybOX language, another MITRE project&rdquo;. Further, as a part of the framework, these &ldquo;observables can be linked to indicators, incidents, TTPs, specific threat actors, adversary campaigns, specific targets, data markings, and courses of action&rdquo; - that it evolves into a &ldquo;complete threat intelligence management system&rdquo;.</p><h4 id=taxii>TAXII</h4><p>Overview: TAXII stands for Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information. It is an &ldquo;application protocol for exchanging CTI over HTTPS, defining &ldquo;a RESTful API (a set of services and message exchanges) and a set of requirements for TAXII Clients and Servers&rdquo; .
An API, or an Application Programming Interface plays the role of a mediator between the Client and the Web Service. The advantage here is that information sharing is done &ldquo;maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what&rdquo;. A RESTful (or REST - representational state transfer) API &ldquo;conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services&rdquo;. For an API to be a RESTful API, it needs to comply with certain criteria like &ldquo;Client-server architecture&rdquo;, with HTTP based requests, &ldquo;Stateless Client-Server communication&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cacheable data&rdquo; etc.</p><p>Purpose: It enables sharing CTI &ldquo;across product, service and organisational boundaries&rdquo; and acts as a &ldquo;transport vehicle for STIX structured threat information&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: The two primary services TAXII provides are: (a) Collection and (b) Channel. The TAXII server has a repository of CTI objects that it allows its Users to host, which can be accessed by consumers. Collection is an interface to this repository. A Channel can be viewed as a many to many interface - that allows a producer to push data to many consumers and a consumer to receive data from many producers.</p><h4 id=traffic-light-protocol-tlp>Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)</h4><h5 id=information-sharing>Information Sharing</h5><p>The critical success factors for cyber resilience and sustenance of a digital ecosystem are:
a) The speed and quality of detection of compromise and cyber-attacks within the entities.
b) The rapidity by which information and guidance is disseminated to all the actual and potential targets.
c) The speed and effectiveness of response within entities as well as across sectors and cross-sectors.</p><p>Conventional paper-based and email-based methods of sharing are not capable of achieving the required speed in information sharing amongst all the stakeholders and participants, since they are less amenable for automated processing. Traffic Light Protocol is a standardised mechanism for sharing information. TLP version 2.0 is the current version of TLP standardized by FIRST. The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration. Information sharing happens from an information source, towards one or more recipients. TLP is a set of four labels used to indicate the sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipients.</p><h5 id=tlp-definitions>TLP definitions</h5><p>Community: Under TLP, a community is a group who share common goals, practices, and informal trust relationships. A community can be as broad as all cybersecurity practitioners in a country (or in a sector or region).</p><p>Organisation: Under TLP, an organisation is a group who share a common affiliation by formal membership and are bound by common policies set by the organisation. An organisation can be as broad as all members of an information sharing organisation, but rarely broader.</p><p>Clients: Under TLP, clients are those people or entities that receive cybersecurity services from an organisation. Clients are by default included in TLP:AMBER so that the recipients may share information further downstream in order for clients to take action to protect themselves. For teams with national responsibility this definition includes stakeholders and constituents.</p><h5 id=tlp-labels>TLP Labels</h5><p>TLP:RED = For the eyes and ears of individual recipients only, no further disclosure. Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon without significant risk for the privacy, reputation, or operations of the organisations involved. Recipients may therefore not share TLP:RED information with anyone else. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting.</p><p>TLP:AMBER = Limited disclosure, recipients can only spread this on a need-to-know basis within their organisation and its clients. Note that TLP:AMBER+STRICT restricts sharing to the organisation only. Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organisations involved. Recipients may share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organisation and its clients, but only on a need-to-know basis to protect their organisation and its clients and prevent further harm. Note: if the source wants to restrict sharing to the organisation only, they must specify TLP:AMBER+STRICT.</p><p>TLP:GREEN = Limited disclosure, recipients can spread this within their community. Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful to increase awareness within their wider community. Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner organisations within their community, but not via publicly accessible channels. TLP:GREEN information may not be shared outside of the community. Note: when “community” is not defined, assume the cybersecurity/defence community.</p><p>TLP:CLEAR = Recipients can spread this to the world, there is no limit on disclosure. Sources may use TLP:CLEAR when information carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:CLEAR information may be shared without restriction.</p><h4 id=oscal>OSCAL</h4><p>Overview: In the context of NIST, an ATO or an Authorization (to operate) is defined as &ldquo;The official management decision given by a senior organisational official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organisational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organisational assets, individuals, other organisations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls&rdquo; . In essence there has to be a formal declaration by a designated authority that authorises operation of an IT product, which includes all the caveats around Risk. Apart from the inherent complexity in handling cyber threats, addressing ATO requirements coupled with the extensive manual processes in handling Risk Management increases the challenges of an Entity&rsquo;s Information Security Team. The four key challenges in this regard stated by NIST are: - (a) Complexity of Information Technology (b) Omnipresent Vulnerabilities (c) Burdensome nature of Regulatory Frameworks (d) Esoteric nature of Risk Management (e) Accelerated rate of obsolescence of Documentation .</p><p>Purpose: The open source, Open Security Controls Assessment Language - or OSCAL, was developed by NIST in collaboration with industry to address the concerns around this space. To overcome the challenges around usage of word processing and spread sheet utilities to handle RMF requirements, improved automation was an imperative. There was a need, therefore, to evolve &ldquo;a shared language for authorization systems to communicate&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: OSCAL uses XML, JSON, and YAML formats, providing &ldquo;machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results&rdquo;. The advantages of OSCAL formats as stated by NIST are: - &ldquo;Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs, Establish and share machine-readable control baselines, Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in your systems, Automate the monitoring and assessment of your system control implementation effectiveness&rdquo; .</p><h4 id=openscap>OpenSCAP</h4><p>Overview: In any enterprise, the IT systems deployed need to be constantly monitored for vulnerabilities so that remediation measures in terms of configuration changes, patch updates and / or application of upgrades are done in a timely manner. This minimizes risk exposure of the assets within, and the enterprise is better guarded against security threats. The Security Content Automation Protocol - SCAP, is a collection of &ldquo;number of open standards that are widely used to enumerate software flaws and configuration issues related to security&rdquo;. In order to associate a metric or measure the possible impact due to the vulnerabilities within the system, applications written for security monitoring leverage these standards. Thus the &ldquo;SCAP suite of specifications standardize the nomenclature and formats&rdquo;, that is leveraged by these vulnerability management tools.</p><p>Purpose: OpenSCAP is an auditing tool that utilizes security check-list content in a defined format called the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF). Combing with other specifications it creates a SCAP-expressed checklist that can be processed by SCAP-validated products.</p><p>Audience: IT / IT Security Administrators, Auditors</p><p>Usage: The OpenSCAP stack consists of different products that can help with &ldquo;assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines&rdquo;, maintaining &ldquo;flexibility and interoperability&rdquo; and &ldquo;reducing the costs of performing security audits&rdquo; . A few of the Tools in the stack include: - (a) OpenSCAP Base: A Command line tool for performing configuration & vulnerability scanning (b) OpenSCAP Daemon: Evaluating Infrastructure’s compliance to SCAP Policy (c) SCAP Workbench: Helps create a custom security profile and facilitates remote scanning.</p><h4 id=open-command--control-openc2>Open Command & Control (OpenC2)</h4><p>Overview: Attackers are in a position to conduct and coordinate various stages of an attack with remarkable sophistication and speed. If Defenders are to sustain their operations, they need to respond with equal alacrity; plan and conduct defense operations in a timeframe that matches the adversary so as to ensure that the latter fails to attain their objectives. But the penetrability of an attack surface is determined by a range of factors that include “complexity, functionality, connectivity” etc. Further, most enterprises do not have an integrated cyber defense implementation; the systems operate in siloes and generally have static configurations. This results in very inefficient cybersecurity operations. Such an environment, by default creates a lag in incident-response-remediation, which gives an adversary &ldquo;asymmetric time advantage&rdquo;, to ensure the success of their attack. In a large enterprise there would be number of heterogenous platforms, technologies, devices, and systems. Effective incident response, getting into the root cause, assessing remediation measures, and mitigating them etc. become complex. In such a context, few challenges of integrating the various components of cyber defense include: - (a) Prohibitive costs (b) Tailored Communication Interfaces&rdquo; (c) Extent of tight-coupling and cohesiveness of the chosen products for integration (d) Need for a middleware etc. As a consequence, scaling of such a solution would depend on ability to get suitable interfaces written or easily available APIs for the different products in use. Paradoxically though, while OEM diversity of solutions do provide an additional layer of security - as attack on one system does not guarantee attack on another, achieving cyber defense integration becomes complex and prohibitive in terms of costs. From an attack perspective, when an attacker penetrates a system and installs a malware which is leveraged to send remote commands from a C2 (Command & Control) Server to infected devices, it is termed a C2 attack. In other words, &ldquo;command and control infrastructure&rdquo; is used by attackers to issue &ldquo;command and control instructions&rdquo; to their victims. From a cyber-defense viewpoint, an assessment of the C2 approach and methods that an attacker uses could be leveraged to identify and associate attackers and attacks, and disrupt malicious activity that are ongoing.</p><p>Purpose: The limitations in integrating cyber defense solutions, stated earlier was the trigger for development of Open Command and Control (OpenC2) . It &ldquo;is a suite of specifications that enable command and control of cyber defense systems and components&rdquo; - facilitating &ldquo;machine to machine communication&rdquo;, through a &ldquo;common language&rdquo;. More important, it does it at very high speeds and in such a way &ldquo;that is agnostic of the overall underlying technologies utilized&rdquo;. But for this standard, every new device would need manual configuration or individual commands sent in real time, which apart from increasing the lag in incident response times, would also have human intervention, making it error prone.</p><h4 id=software-bill-of-materials-sbom>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</h4><p>Overview: The entire source code of a software is referred to as its codebase. It is a common practice for developers to integrate with their code, third party components that are licensed and either commercially available or are open source. A SBOM or software Bill of Materials is an inventory of all the &ldquo;open source and third-party components&rdquo; that are present, providing details of their versions and status of the patches within the codebase of a software application / product. Information security teams can use this information to assess security & license related risks. Akin to the Manufacturing industry&rsquo;s Bill of Material (from where SBOM has been derived) where the codification schemes of the parts provided by OEM and Suppliers are distinct, based on which a successful trace to the correct supplier happens when a part goes defective; here too a trail to the accurate third party is established by virtue of the SBOM. There are four stages of an SBOM life cycle. They are: (a) Produce SBOM - Collating the information required for an SBOM at each stage of the software lifecycle from existing tools and solutions. Such solutions normally include: - &ldquo;intellectual property review&rdquo;, &ldquo;license management workflow tools&rdquo;, &ldquo;version control systems&rdquo; etc. (b) Deliver - In the case of opensource tools, the SBOM information can be held as metadata, while for compiled versions the SBOM and the software product are bundled together. (c) Update - If the software is updated in any manner, then any changes in SBOM too needs to be recorded. (d) Consume - In order to utilise SBOM, the SBOM data should be in a machine readable format. However, the decision on choosing the appropriate format that should be adopted for SBOM needs to be taken. The three standard and common formats in use are CycloneDX, SWID and SPDX.</p><h5 id=cyclonedx>CycloneDX</h5><p>Purpose: &ldquo;OWASP CycloneDX is a lightweight&rdquo; SBOM specification &ldquo;designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis&rdquo;, created in 2017 . The intent was to create a &ldquo;fully automatable, security-focused SBOM standard&rdquo;. Existing specifications like Package URL, CPE, SWID etc., have been incorporated into CycloneDX. Each such SBOM can have (a) Bill of Material Metadata (supplier, manufacturer, firmware etc. that it describes), (b) Components - detailed inventory of the software components, which includes type, identity, license etc. (c) Services - description of external APIs, that the utility may invoke (d) Dependencies - interrelationship between components (e) Compositions - that describes the &lsquo;completeness&rsquo; of the SBOM. (f) Extensions - For building rapid prototyping of enhancements.</p><p>Usage: Software Inventory description, Analysis, Analysis of vulnerabilities and their mitigation, Supply Chain (Software) risk assessments, Compliance of License requirements, Traceability of updates and modifications, Integrity checks of signed components etc.</p><h5 id=swid>SWID</h5><p>Purpose: To enhance transparency in monitoring Software installed within the enterprise, Software Identification (SWID) tags were conceptualised and defined originally by ISO (2012) and later updated as ISO/IEC standard (2015). Description of a specific software release is held in the SWID Tag files. The standard further &ldquo;defines a lifecycle where a SWID Tag is added to an endpoint as part of the software product’s installation process and deleted by the product’s uninstall process&rdquo;. In order to capture the lifecycle of a software component, the SWID specification defines following types of Tags: (a) Primary Tag (b) Patch Tag (c) Corpus Tag and (d) Supplemental Tag. SWID Tag that identifies and describes: - (a) a software product installed on a computing device is called a Patch Tag (b) a patch that was installed for making a change of the software installed on the device is referred to as a Patch Tag (c) the pre-installation state of a software product is called a Corpus tag and finally a SWID Tag that permits &ldquo;additional information to be associated with any referenced SWID tag&rdquo; is referred to as a Supplemental tag.</p><p>Usage: Few use cases are: (a) It can be used as Software Bill of Material for the software products and applications installed (b) Inventory of installed software can be regularly monitored (c) Software vulnerability identification at end points can be carried out (d) Ensures proper patch management (e) Detects unauthorized or corrupt software prior to their installation and prevents their installation.</p><h5 id=spdx>SPDX</h5><p>Purpose: SPDX or Software Package Data Exchange , is an ISO /IEC standard. It is used for communicating software bill of material information that includes components, licenses, copyright and security information. It is an evolving &ldquo;set of data exchange standards&rdquo; that would assist enterprises with their software supply chain ecosystem by allowing each of them &ldquo;to share human-readable and machine-processable software metadata&rdquo; with one another. Like in the case of SWID, stated earlier, work here too began because of limitations that existed in the earlier days of sharing opensource components, resulting in duplication of efforts. Also, collaboration was difficult then. SPDX project created &ldquo;a common metadata exchange format&rdquo; which allowed details about software packages and associated content to be collected, shared and made effective automation of the related tasks, feasible. The file formats used here include JSON, XML and YAML. A valid SPDX document has a defined structure with defined sections as stated in the SPDX specification. The section that is mandatory is the &ldquo;Creation Information&rsquo; (version numbers, license of data etc.) - primarily provided for forward and backward compatibility of the tools. The others include &ldquo;Package Information&rdquo;, &ldquo;File Information&rdquo;, &ldquo;Snippet Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Licensing Information.</p><p>Usage: Description of software components and their interrelationships; Tracking licensing, copyright information related to IP; Tracking executables to the source files etc.</p><h4 id=openioc>OpenIOC</h4><p>Overview: Like in the case of collating evidence, analyzing them and then weaving it together to reconstruct a crime scene, a cybersecurity analyst too as a part of her function tries to gather data around different events related to new and emerging threats. The nature of this data could be &ldquo;metadata elements or much more complex malicious code and content samples that require advanced reverse engineering&rdquo;. The final output of this action is what is generally referred to as IOC or Indicators of compromise. In other words, IOC can be defined as &ldquo;a forensic artifact or remnant of an intrusion that can be identified on a host or network&rdquo;.</p><p>Purpose: OpenIOC is an XML based open framework used for sharing CTI.</p><p>Usage: The format used is machine-readable and assists sharing threats related to the latest IOCs, with other enterprises, helping achieve real-time protection. OpenIoc provides a pre-defined set of indicators as a part of the framework. The extensible nature of the base schema allows add on indicators from different sources. The IOC use cases include: (a) Finding Malware - Used to find known malware (b) Methodology - These IOCs help find suspicious utilities that are unknown. For instance, writing an IOC for a specific condition of an unsigned dll that was loaded from a folder that did not have &ldquo;windows32system&rdquo; in its path (c) Bulk - Used for exact matches (d) Investigative - Tracking information like, metadata related to &ldquo;installation of backdoors&rdquo;, &ldquo;execution of tools&rdquo; etc. in an IOC and using that to prioritise the systems that would be taken up to be analysed.</p><h4 id=openedr>OpenEDR</h4><p>Overview: Endpoint detection and response or EDR is a technology that focuses on endpoints and network related events. The agent on the host system helps log the information generated and stores it in a database. This repository is what is leveraged for event monitoring and generating reports. Different EDR solutions package their functions and features differently. Some focus more at the agent level, some have different way of handling schedules for collection and analysis, some others carry out integration tasks with a difference. Functions of EDR are: (a) Traffic and data monitoring from endpoints and checking for anomalies hinting a breach. (b) Automated responses - Removal of malicious files and alerts to information security teams. (c) Search for threats and their signatures through analytics. The core functions of all tools in this space are the same - &ldquo;continuous monitoring and analysis&rdquo; for being proactive to respond to threats.</p><p>Purpose: OpenEDR is an EDR tool that is both free and its source code available in public domain. It consists of the following components: - (a) Core Library (b) Service (c) Process Monitoring (d) System Monitor (e) File-System Mini-Filter (f) Network Monitor (g) Low-Level Registry Monitoring Component (h) Self-Protection Provider (i) Low-Level Process Monitoring Component.</p><p>Usage: One of OpenEDR’s strengths is to enable a user to affect an accurate RCA. Without a clear understanding of root cause, mitigation measures would prove inadequate. The output from the tool provides &ldquo;actionable knowledge&rdquo; which helps speed up response. Further its, “Integrated Security Architecture” helps deliver a “Full Attack Vector Visibility including MITRE Framework”.</p><h4 id=opendxl>OpenDXL</h4><p>Overview: Proliferation of different technologies from various IT Infra and Security Vendors over time, with different upgrade paths, coupled with several home-grown initiatives – all, connected through an underlying network, has made IT Security Management a complex task. Achieving seamless integration between security products from different Vendors has been a constant challenge. API driven integration comes with major maintenance issues. Integration of products from different Vendors also has administrative overheads that includes external dependencies. For instance, getting a buy in from each of the Vendors, their prioritization, commercial interests etc. An application&rsquo;s limitations for easily accessing emerging CTI data becomes an impediment for each, to apply the insights on emerging threats, making the environment vulnerability prone. As a result, the cyber resilience posture is affected adversely. The mechanism through which security solutions are connected and integration of disparate security systems are achieved is termed as Orchestration. Since substantial volume of output logs are created by security tools currently, SOCs tend to miss intrusions. Security Orchestration addresses this concern.</p><p>Purpose: Open Data Exchange Layer or OpenDXL has been developed with the intent of enabling &ldquo;security devices to share intelligence and orchestrate security operations in real time&rdquo;. It facilitates the developer community to establish handshakes between security products and minimize lead times of threat defense, by improving &ldquo;context of analysis&rdquo;, shortening &ldquo;workflows of the threat defense lifecycle&rdquo; etc. The key goals of OpenDXL can be summarized as follows: (a) Enhance flexibility (b) Make integration easier (c) Accelerate development by providing appropriate toolsets (d) Increase Sec Ops ability in creating &ldquo;cross-product, cross-vendor security automation&rdquo; and (e) Ensure that API changes by Vendors do not adversely impact integration.</p><p>Usage: Use Cases include: &ldquo;Deception threat events, File and application reputation changes, Mobile devices and assets discovered, Network and user behavior changes, High-fidelity alerts, Vulnerability and indicator of compromise (IoC) data”.</p><h4 id=infrastructure-as-code-iac>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h4><p>Overview: Like all disciplines in IT, managing IT Infrastructure has gone through its own evolution process. In the past it was customary for manually addressing all aspects of configuration, whether it was hardware or software over which the applications were required to run on. Costs, scalability, availability were all challenges that the organisations had to surmount. Monitoring performance of IT Infra or pinpointing the problem during troubleshooting continued to be an Achilles heel for the IT Infra team. Due to the human intensive nature of deploying configurations, inconsistencies crept in. Therefore, there was a need to explore the possibility of automating configuration management and thereby managing and provisioning IT Infrastructure through code. In that context, two file formats are defined here: (a) JSON: JSON or JavaScript Object Notation originated as a page scripting language in the Netscape Navigator era, for its web browser. It is a format with a defined set of rules that is &ldquo;text-based, human-readable&rdquo;, leveraged for data exchange between &ldquo;web clients and web servers&rdquo;, sometimes used as an alternative to XML. (b) YAML: YAML or yet another markup language (referred to also as, ain&rsquo;t another markup language) - A human readable, easily comprehensible language, used for data and not documents is a &ldquo;data serialization language&rdquo; which is regularly leveraged while writing configuration files.</p><p>Purpose: Infrastructure as Code or IaC, is defined as &ldquo;The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools&rdquo;. In effect it leverages a DevOps approach to deploy IT infrastructure - networks, VMs etc. Akin to a codebase generating identical binary every time, here too the same environment is generated during every deployment. There are two approaches to IaC: (a) Declarative - Where the required state of the system is defined. An environment would need a tailored definition with regards its components and configuration. The definition file describes that. Depending on the kind file formats that the Platform supports - be they JSON, YAML or XML, syntax for describing IaC can be decided. (b) Imperative - &ldquo;defines the specific commands needed to achieve the desired configuration&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: Some of the advantages of using IaC are: (a) Reduce Cost (b) Accelerate deployment (c) Less Errors (d) Enhance consistency (e) &ldquo;Eliminate configuration drift&rdquo;. More insights can be gleaned from studying Server automation and config management tools like Chef, Puppet, Saltstack etc.</p><h4 id=policy-as-code>Policy-as-Code</h4><p>Overview: In a growing tech landscape, it is inevitable not to think of automation when rolling out policies. As proliferation of IT driven solutions take place, protecting the systems from threats is an imperative. For which, rules and procedures are defined as a part of security policy formulation - be it, access control, authorization, network security etc. In essence, a policy is a rule that stipulates the criteria for code deployment against the backdrop of the security control implemented or a set of steps to be executed automatically when there is a particular security event.</p><p>Purpose: Policy-as-code is the use of a high-level declarative language to automate managing rules and policies centrally. Leveraging this approach, users write the policies using Python, YAML or Rego - a high-level declarative language &ldquo;built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures&rdquo;, depending on the kind of policy-as-code tool that is being used. While IaC benefits the IT operations team where automated provisioning of Infrastructure is involved, policy-as-code focuses on security operations and compliance management. To leverage policy-as-code the user may choose to use a tool like Open Policy Agent or OPA, purpose of which is to provide a common framework while applying policy-as-code to any domain. OPA is a &ldquo;general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack&rdquo;. It allows authoring of policies through Rego. OPA can be leveraged to outsource policy decisions from the relevant service. Eg: Boolean decisions of whether an API call should be allowed, Quota left for a user, the updates to be applied for a particular resource etc.</p><p>Usage: The advantages of using policy-as-code are: (a) Enhanced efficiency of enforcement and sharing of policies vis-a-vis the manual route (b) Accelerated operations because of automated policy enforcement (c) Swifter reviewing of policies as there is no requirement for engineers to discuss, they need to only examine the code (d) Improved collaboration within and across teams (e) Accuracy (f) Well defined version controlling of the policies and ability to roll back to the previous version (g) Helps reduce critical errors in production environments.</p><h4 id=omg-requirements-interchange-format-reqif>OMG Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF)</h4><p>Overview: Requirements management has been in vogue across different industries for a while. The collaboration requirements in the manufacturing industry – car manufacturing, for instance, uses dedicated authoring tools for their requirement management. Since collaboration requirements are intense, requirements management cross organisational boundaries - and different entities using different authoring tools find it a challenge to work on the same requirements repository. There was a compelling case, therefore, for a &ldquo;generic, non-proprietary format&rdquo; for information exchange. Hence, The Requirements Interchange Format or ReqIF was created for enterprises to exchange requirements data, by transferring XML documents that comply to the ReqIF format.</p><p>Purpose: Any product development during the initial stages has a requirement gathering phase. This is where ReqIF finds a key use, as multiple entities could be involved. ReqIF facilitates seamless sharing of requirements between agencies, even if each uses a different tool. It is far more efficient than formats like Word, Excel or PDF as it “allows for a loss-free exchange”.</p><p>Usage: Few of the advantages of using this format are: Improved collaboration between entities; Obviates the need to use the same authoring tools, Agencies interacting with multiple entities (eg: Suppliers) do not need stack up authoring tools that their respective Customers use.</p><h4 id=oasis-cacao-for-cybersecurity>OASIS CACAO for Cybersecurity</h4><p>Overview: It is apparent that in order to defend against cybersecurity threats, a structured set of rules need to be defined. A cybersecurity playbook is generally considered to be a comprehensive manual that spells out actions to be taken when there is theft or loss of data. To that end, enterprises need to &ldquo;identify, create, and document the prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps&rdquo;, currently in most cases done manually. These steps considered together, constitute a course of action playbook. Like in other areas of the cybersecurity domain, here too lack of a standard mechanism to &ldquo;document and share these playbooks across organisational boundaries&rdquo; compounded with inadequate automation, proves to be a challenge.</p><p>Purpose: OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (or CACAO) for Cyber Security Technical Committee (TC), tackles this challenge by &ldquo;defining a sequence of cyber defense actions that can be executed for each type of playbook&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: This will help entities to: (a) “create course of action playbooks in a structured machine-readable format” (b) “digitally sign course of action playbooks” (c) “securely share course of action playbooks across organisational boundaries and technological solutions” and (d) “document processing instructions for course of action playbooks in a machine-readable format”.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html rel=external target=_blank>https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/smart rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:6><p><a href=https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart rel=external target=_blank>https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 22 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=lifecycle-management-of-systems-and-software>Lifecycle management of systems and software</h1><p>The <a href=https://www.iso.org/standard/84709.html rel=external target=_blank>ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1:2024 - Systems and software engineering — Life cycle management — Part 1</a> publication provides unified and consolidated guidance on life cycle management of systems and software, complementing the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.</p><p>The standard defines a number of terms that are useful to establish a common understanding amongst the stakeholders responsible for the life cycle management of systems and software.

The processes can be used by acquirer organisations, suppliers (OEMs, system integrators, service providers) and management to fulfil their responsibilities pertaining to the system of interest. Processes are performed as required to achieve stated objectives within a lifecycle stage.</p><p>Organisations, when considering a new project, should select a life cycle model and the necessary life cycle processes to satisfy applicable life cycle stage entry or exit criteria. Decisions as to which processes to select should be based on cost-benefit or risk reduction.</p><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 provides a specific example of four groups of system life cycle processes: Agreement, Organisational Project-enabling, Technical Management and Technical. The same is depicted in Figure 2-4, along with sub clause numbers of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 in which the specific purpose, expected outcomes, activities and tasks of the processes are described.</p><p><strong>Organisational Project-Enabling processes</strong> provide enabling resources and infrastructure that are used to create, support, and monitor projects and to assess project effectiveness. <strong>Technical Management processes </strong>provide requirements so that adequate planning, assessment, and control activities are performed to manage processes and life cycle stages. The role of these two groups of processes is to achieve the project goals within applicable life cycle stages to satisfy an agreement. The <strong>Technical Processes</strong> are used to perform life cycle related work related to engineering of systems.</p><p>Projects may need to establish relationships with other projects within the organisation, as well as those in other organisations.

The ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> Architecture Description (AD) international standard helps organisations to express and document architecture descriptions of large and complex systems in a standardised manner.</p><p>Every complex system has multiple stakeholders across the federated digital ecosystem. Expressing a system’s architecture using AD will help all the stakeholders to understand its evolution, composition, behaviour and maintainability. The AD methodology is useful to specify requirements of various entities, including software, systems, enterprises, systems of systems, families of systems, products (goods or services), product lines, service lines, technologies and business domains. The Architectural Description conceptual foundations<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> are summarised below.</p><h4 id=ad-concepts>AD Concepts</h4><ul><li><p>A <a href=/docs/glossary/index.html#glossary_system><strong>system</strong></a> is situated in an <strong>environment</strong>. The environment of a system may contain other systems. The system’s environment is bounded by and understood through the identification and analysis of the system’s stakeholders and their concerns. The environment determines the totality of influences upon the system throughout its life cycle, including its interactions with that environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholders</strong> have interests in a system, which are expressed as <strong>concerns</strong>. Concerns arise throughout the life cycle from system needs and requirements, from design choices and from implementation and operating considerations. A concern could manifest in many forms, such as in relation to one or more stakeholder needs, goals, expectations, responsibilities, requirements, design constraints, assumptions, dependencies, quality attributes, architecture decisions, risks or other issues pertaining to the system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architecture of a system</strong> constitutes what is essential about the system in relation to its environment (in an abstract form). The term <strong>system-of-interest</strong> is also used to refer to the system whose architecture is under consideration in the preparation of an AD.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architecture descriptions</strong> (AD) are used to express architectures for systems of interest (in a documented form). They include one or more Architecture Views that address the concerns of stakeholders. AD may include information not part of any architecture view. Examples include system overview, architecture rationale etc.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Architecture Viewpoint</strong> frames one or more concerns and a concern can be framed by more than one viewpoint. Examples of viewpoints are i) business/ mission viewpoint, ii) deployment viewpoint.</p></li><li><p>Each Architecture Viewpoint has exactly one <strong>Architecture View</strong> that expresses the architecture of the system of interest in accordance with the Architecture Viewpoint and addresses the concerns framed by the governing viewpoint. Thus, a viewpoint is a way of looking at systems and a view is a result of applying a viewpoint. Examples of views are i) business/ mission view, ii) deployment view, iii) operations view.</p></li><li><p>Architecture View is composed of one or more <strong>Architecture Models</strong>. Each architectural model is developed using the conventions and methods established by its associated viewpoint. An architectural model may participate in more than one view.

Systems security engineering is a subdiscipline of systems engineering that addresses security-relevant considerations intended to produce secure outcomes.</p><p>In recent years there is a clear recognition that “Systems security engineering must be fundamental to systems engineering. Security fundamentals must be clearly understood by stakeholders and effectively evaluated in a way that considers broad goals with security functions and outcomes.”<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>NIST SP 800-160 Vol 1r1 (Nov 2022) recognises that “building trustworthy, secure systems cannot occur in a vacuum with stovepipes for software, hardware, information technology, and the human element (e.g., designers, operators, users, attackers of these systems). Rather, it requires a transdisciplinary approach to protection, a determination across all assets where loss could occur, and an understanding of adversity, including how adversaries attack and compromise systems. It addresses security issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements and protection needs and the use of established engineering processes to ensure that such requirements and needs are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor across the entire life cycle of the system.”</p><p>This publication describes the security design principles, concepts, and techniques that are part of a trustworthy secure design approach. These can be applied in the development of new capabilities or systems, modification of existing capabilities or systems, and development of system of systems. It is intended to be used by:</p><ul><li><p>Systems engineers, security engineers, and other engineering professionals.</p></li><li><p>Professionals and teams, who perform other system life cycle activities or tasks, such as those listed below</p><ul><li><p>Security governance, risk management, and oversight</p></li><li><p>Security verification, validation, testing, evaluation, auditing, assessment, inspection, and monitoring</p></li><li><p>Acquisition, budgeting, and project management</p></li><li><p>Operations, maintenance, sustainment, logistics, and support</p></li><li><p>Providers of technology-related products, systems, or services</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The core objective of the publication is to be engineering-based, not operations- or technology-based. Organisations can adapt the concepts and principles for trustworthy secure design, the systems life cycle processes and security-relevant activities and tasks described in the publication to achieve consistent security outcomes in the capabilities delivered by their systems.</p><p><strong>System Security Viewpoints</strong></p><p>The publication defines three predominant viewpoints of system security, viz i) system function, ii) security function, and iii) life cycle assets.</p><ul><li><p><strong>System function</strong> is the system’s purpose or role as fulfilled by the totality of the capability it delivers combined with its intended use. Every system is required to satisfy all the stakeholder capability needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security function</strong> is the system’s fulfilment of the stakeholder’s protection capability needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life cycle assets</strong> are associated with the system but are not engineered into or delivered with the system. Life cycle assets typically include intellectual property, data and information associated with the system, and supporting assets for development, production and sustenance of the system. The association of lifecycle assets with the system means that they can be the direct cause of loss or a conduit/means through which a loss can occur.</p></li><li><p>The system function is the predominant viewpoint and establishes the context for the security function and the associated system life cycle assets.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Systems Security Engineering Framework</strong></p><p>The systems security engineering framework provides a conceptual view of the key contexts within which systems security engineering activities are conducted. It defines three contexts for conducting activities and tasks:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>problem context</strong> to help ensure that the engineering is driven by a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>solution context</strong> to drive the effort to provide the solution, supported by a set of activities to design and realize the solution.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>trustworthiness context</strong> is a decision-making context that provides an evidence-based demonstration – through reasoning – that the system of interest is deemed trustworthy (or not) based on a set of claims derived from security objectives.</p></li></ul><h3 id=nist-sp-800-160-vol-2>NIST SP 800-160 Vol 2</h3><p>Cyber resiliency for systems that include or depend on cyber resources is a part of operational resilience but needs specific guidance due to its distinctive characteristics. The publication provides guidance on how to apply cyber resiliency concepts, constructs, and engineering practices to systems security engineering and risk management. It is to be used by systems security engineering and other professionals, who are responsible for activities and tasks related to system life cycle and risk management processes within and external to the organisation.</p><p>While much of the cyber resiliency analysis in the publication uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&amp;CK™) framework, organisations are not constrained to use only the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework but can use other frameworks too.</p><p>Useful concepts from the publication are described below. Readers are advised to consult the publication for detailed information and guidance on cyber resiliency.</p><p><strong>Cyber-resilient systems</strong> are systems that have security measures or safeguards “built in” as a foundational part of the architecture and design and that display a high level of resiliency to withstand cyber-attacks, faults, and failures and continue to operate in a degraded or debilitated state to carry out the mission-essential functions of the organisation.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency engineering practices</strong> are the methods, processes, modelling, and analytical techniques used to identify and analyse proposed solutions. These practices are applied in system life cycle processes so that the resultant <strong>cyber resiliency solutions</strong> are aligned with the stakeholder requirements and protection needs.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency engineering framework</strong> provides constructs that include cyber resiliency goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, and design principles. While these constructs are applied at the system level in the publication, they can also be applied beyond the system level to mission and business function level, organisational level and sector level. The framework is based on Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework developed by the MITRE Corporation<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>,<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>.</p><p>Cyber resiliency goals and objectives provide a vocabulary for describing what properties and capabilities are needed. Cyber resiliency techniques, approaches, and design principles provide a vocabulary for discussing how a system can achieve its cyber resiliency goals and objectives.</p><p>Four cyber resiliency goals, namely Anticipate, Withstand, Recover and Adapt, eight cyber resiliency objectives and 14 cyber resiliency techniques are part of the cyber resiliency engineering framework.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency solutions</strong> are relevant only if they have some effect on risk. Hence their primary focus is to reduce the risk by reducing the three core factors</p><ul><li>the <strong>likelihood of occurrence</strong> of threat events,</li><li>the ability of threat events to cause harm, i.e., the <strong>likelihood of impact</strong>,</li><li>the extent of harm from threat events, i.e., the <strong>level of impact</strong>.</li></ul><p>The publication describes three models, namely the <strong>risk model, threat model</strong> and <strong>consequence (impact) model</strong> for cyber resiliency. It further identifies controls from NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 that directly support cyber resiliency. The principle applied for associating controls with cyber resiliency is that “cyber resiliency is about ensuring continued mission operations despite the fact that an adversary has established a foothold in the organisation’s systems and cyber infrastructure”. It also provides guidance on adversary-oriented analysis for achieving cyber resiliency, specifically the perspective of protecting systems against adversarial threats using MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ for Enterprise<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> and ATT&amp;CK™ for Industrial Control Systems (ICS)<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> frameworks.
