from QCI and other frameworks that are related to individual and organisational competencies. Readers must consult the authoritative sources for the actual guidelines.</p><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of People</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=workforce-competencies>Workforce Competencies</h1><p>The digital ecosystems of modern enterprises are large and complex, usually spread geographically across the country and the world. The ecosystems encompass a large number and variety of technologies, products, platforms, systems, networks, applications, databases and services, which may be deployed on-premises, on cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) or in hybrid mode.</p><p>Enterprises usually have multiple teams of IT, OT, IIoT, information security and cybersecurity professionals and managers, who are responsible to carry out the organisations’ functions, activities and tasks related to the digital ecosystem of the organisation. CSEs and other organisations would derive significant benefits by establishing a strategic program and structured approach to ensure that their workforce and teams managing the digital ecosystem have the requisite cybersecurity competence (knowledge, skills and levels of expertise) to be effective in handling the entire gamut of work and responsibilities of IT, OT, IIoT, information security and cybersecurity.</p><h3 id=workforce-composition>Workforce Composition</h3><p>Given the size and complexity of digital ecosystem, it may be impractical for most CSEs and other organisations to depend solely upon their internal workforce to acquire, implement, engineer, operate, manage and sustain the ecosystem. In practice, the organisations have a <strong>composite workforce</strong> that has a mix of own employees, hired manpower, specialist (OEM, ISV, SI, SaaS) teams and resources of managed services providers (MSPs), who work together to carry out the functions, activities and tasks related to the digital ecosystem.</p><h4 id=workforce-hierarchy>Workforce Hierarchy</h4><p>At an organisational level the digital ecosystem workforce can be divided into multiple levels of hierarchy, as given below. Typical job titles in each level indicate the associated job functions, tasks, and responsibilities.</p><ul><li><p>Senior management level – Vice Presidents, CTO, CIO, CISO, CSO, Heads of Business Units, Divisions, Departments.</p></li><li><p>Middle and lower management level – Project Managers, Technology Managers, Operations Managers, Security Managers, Cyber Defence Team Leads, NOC and SOC Team Leads, GRC Managers, Workforce Development Managers etc.</p></li><li><p>Individual Contributor level – Operators, Analysts, Administrators, Engineers, Specialists, Technicians, Architects, Developers, Testers, Quality Testers, Apprentices, Associates, Interns.</p></li></ul><p>Senior and middle level managerial roles are always assigned to employees of the organisations. Technical work and its deliverables could be assigned to external teams from OEMs, SIs, MSPs and other service providers, as long as the overall supervision and oversight is handled by designated senior and middle level managers of the organisation. The middle and lower management levels, and individual contributors, are accountable and responsible for day-to-day operational activities and tasks.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
Note</summary><div class=box-content><p>The concept of &ldquo;virtual managers&rdquo; or &ldquo;external advisors with C-level access&rdquo; is gaining acceptance amongst many organisations, who need such services in a more flexible, scalable and cost-effective manner. The virtual manager, for example, a virtual chief information security officer (vCISO) performs most of the core functions as a traditional, full-time manager. They just differ in terms of their engagement model (part time) and presence (non-physical) in the organisation.</p></div></details><h4 id=workforce_specialisations>Workforce Specialisations</h4><p>The sheer breadth and variety of the digital ecosystem technologies, products, deployment models, processes and practices in an organisation makes it impossible for any professional to develop competency in every area. Organisations therefore require professionals with different specialisations to work together in teams. An illustrative list of knowledge and skill specialisation areas for the composite workforce is given below. <a href=https://www.nciipc.gov.in/documents/CAF/Book_Personnel-Certification-Scheme_vF_v.P_31.03.2024.pdf rel=external target=_blank>Source: NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for Cybersecurity Professionals</a>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>.</th><th>Knowledge and Skills Specialisation Areas</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><em>Knowledge Area</em></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Network Infrastructure & Network Security</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Systems (HW, VM, Firmware, OS) Security</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Software and Platform Operations Security</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Secure Systems Engineering</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Secure Software Design & Development</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Enterprise Supply Chain</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Enterprise IT and Information Security</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Enterprise Cyber Defence and Security Operations</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Data Analytics</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Cyber Forensics</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Cyber Security Training & Awareness</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>ICS Cyber Security</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><em>Skills</em></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Programming & Scripting</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Managing and Securing Systems, Networks, Applications</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Managing and Securing Information, Data And Identities</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Custom Software Development and Management</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Cyber Defence and Security Operations</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Others (OEM/ ISV Technologies and Products)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each knowledge and skill area also has an expertise level (basic, intermediate, expert) associated with it. The expertise levels should generally be mapped to the workforce hierarchy, keeping in view the functions executed by a particular hierarchy of the workforce, the size of organisation and the complexity of their digital ecosystem. For example, junior levels are expected to acquire at least the basic level of expertise, while middle and senior levels are expected to acquire intermediate or expert level of expertise. Professionals working with the OEMs, ISVs, SIs, MSPs and other service providers are expected to have intermediate or expert level of expertise in their respective areas of specialisation.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
