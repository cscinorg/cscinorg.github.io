They promote the development of Common Application Software (CAS), allowing states and departments to configure applications for specific needs without altering core functionalities, reducing duplication of efforts. The guidelines advocate for the adoption of open-source tools and configurable components to enhance innovation, minimize vendor lock-in, and streamline development processes. Additionally, they address metadata standards, multi-language support, and adherence to software engineering protocols to ensure consistency, security, and quality. By fostering reusability, scalability, and rapid deployment, the guidelines aim to facilitate the creation of robust, cloud-ready applications that align with MeitY&rsquo;s vision for a digitally empowered society, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs for government and critical sectors.</p><h6 id=cloud-security-best-practices>Cloud Security Best Practices</h6><p>The guidelines provide a detailed framework to ensure the secure adoption and management of cloud services by government entities and other stakeholders. The document outlines essential security measures to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability in cloud environments. It covers areas such as access control, data encryption, incident response, compliance, and governance, emphasizing the shared responsibility model between cloud service providers (CSPs) and users. The guidelines aim to address risks like unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations while ensuring that cloud deployments align with regulatory requirements and international security standards. By following these best practices, organizations can minimize vulnerabilities, enhance trust in cloud technologies, and ensure the secure handling of sensitive information.</p><h6 id=guidelines-for-procurement-of-cloud-services>Guidelines for Procurement of Cloud Services</h6><p>The guidelines provide a comprehensive framework to help government departments transition to cloud-based solutions while ensuring compliance with security and regulatory standards. These guidelines aim to standardize the procurement process, enabling government entities to adopt scalable, cost-efficient, and flexible cloud services effectively. They emphasize critical aspects such as Service Level Agreements (SLAs), data security, privacy, contractual terms, and risk management. The document offers a Master Service Agreement (MSA) template to address key concerns like data ownership, exit strategies, and dispute resolution while highlighting the differences between traditional IT and cloud service procurement. By outlining roles and responsibilities for stakeholders, such as cloud service providers (CSPs) and system integrators (SIs) and recommending best practices for safeguarding data integrity and availability, the guidelines ensure that digital transformation initiatives in the public sector are aligned with national objectives and operational requirements. These guidelines empower government departments to make informed decisions, promoting transparency, efficiency, and consistency in cloud adoption.</p><h6 id=guidelines-for-government-departments-on-contractual-terms-related-to-cloud-services>Guidelines for Government Departments on Contractual Terms Related to Cloud Services</h6><p>The guidelines provide a structured framework to assist government entities in drafting and negotiating contracts with cloud service providers (CSPs). These guidelines aim to address critical contractual elements such as data ownership, security, privacy, liability, indemnity, termination, and exit management to safeguard the interests of government departments. By focusing on risk mitigation and compliance with regulatory and operational requirements, the guidelines ensure that cloud contracts are robust, clear, and enforceable. They empower government departments to establish fair and balanced agreements that protect sensitive data, ensure service continuity, and foster accountability, thereby enabling secure and efficient cloud adoption.</p><h6 id=guidelines-for-user-departments-on-service-level-agreement-for-procuring-cloud-services>Guidelines for User Departments on Service Level Agreement for Procuring Cloud Services</h6><p>The guidelines provide a structured approach for government departments to draft, evaluate, and enforce SLAs when adopting cloud services. These guidelines aim to ensure clarity and accountability between government users and cloud service providers by defining key performance metrics, responsibilities, and penalties for non-compliance. They address critical areas such as service uptime, data security, response times, and disaster recovery, ensuring that the agreed service levels meet operational and regulatory requirements. By offering a detailed SLA framework, the guidelines empower government departments to establish measurable expectations, monitor service performance, and safeguard their interests in cloud procurement agreements.</p><h6 id=master-service-agreement-for-procurement-of-cloud-services>Master Service Agreement for Procurement of Cloud Services</h6><p>The MSA provides a standardized contractual framework to facilitate transparent and efficient cloud service procurement by government entities. It outlines the terms and conditions governing the relationship between government departments and cloud service providers (CSPs), addressing critical aspects such as service delivery, data ownership, security, privacy, termination clauses, and exit management. It ensures that cloud services are procured with clearly defined responsibilities, measurable performance metrics, and robust dispute resolution mechanisms. By providing a comprehensive and legally sound agreement template, the MSA enables government departments to safeguard their interests, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and build trust with CSPs while transitioning to cloud technologies.</p><h6 id=audit-criteria-for-cloud-service-providers>Audit Criteria for Cloud Service Providers</h6><p>The audit criteria document establishes a comprehensive framework to evaluate and ensure that CSPs meet the required standards for delivering secure, reliable, and compliant cloud services to government entities. These criteria outline essential audit parameters across areas such as data security, privacy, service availability, incident management, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and operational efficiency. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide a standardized evaluation mechanism to assess the capabilities and performance of CSPs, ensuring they align with the stringent requirements of government projects. By implementing these audit criteria, government departments can identify trustworthy CSPs, mitigate risks, and uphold the integrity of their cloud-based operations.</p><h5 id=audience-6>Audience</h5><p>Ministries of GoI, States and organisations in the public sector.</p><h5 id=usage-6>Usage</h5><p>The guidelines enable ministries, government departments and others to use the GI Cloud services offered by the empaneled cloud service providers.</p><h3 id=ministry-of-home-affairs-mha>Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)</h3><h4 id=nispg-50>NISPG 5.0</h4><h5 id=overview--purpose-7>Overview & Purpose</h5><p>The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG) version 5.0, issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India, focuses on establishing guidelines to help secure “information” that may impact internal security and national security.
