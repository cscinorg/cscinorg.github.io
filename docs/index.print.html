We now have a vibrant <strong>national cyberspace</strong>, which manifests through a <strong>digital ecosystem</strong> formed by geographically dispersed, interconnected and federated conglomeration of systems, networks, data repositories, applications, devices, processes and services.</p><p>The cyberspace is vital to national security, economy, public health, public safety and overall national well-being. The digital ecosystem enables critical sector entities and other organisations to deliver the national critical functions through business and industrial processes that use the digital infrastructure. Hence, it is essential to build, maintain and continually improve the resilience of the digital ecosystem of our critical sectors in a coordinated manner. Any loss of trust in the same has severe consequences for users and other stakeholders of the national cyberspace.</p><p>The critical sectors in India are listed below:</p><ul><li>Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI)</li><li>Telecom</li><li>Government</li><li>Power and Energy (P&amp;E)</li><li>Transport</li><li>Strategic and Public Enterprises (S&amp;PE)</li><li>Health</li><li>Defence</li></ul><p>Examples of critical functions delivered through the cyberspace in India are listed below:</p><ul><li>Banking, financial markets and insurance payments, transactions, clearing and settlement.</li><li>Voice and data connectivity and internet services.</li><li>E-Governance and citizen services.</li><li>Control, operation and management of utility services like power, fuel, gas etc.</li><li>Control, operation and management of transportation services like railway/ metro, air traffic, ports etc.</li><li>Services related to defence, internal security, public safety, and law enforcement.</li><li>Public health related services.</li></ul><p>The IT Act 2000 (amended 2008) applies to users and providers of the digital ecosystem, including home users, MSMEs, large enterprises, government & non-government entities. It was framed to help secure the digital ecosystem while in use by the government, businesses and others for their service delivery, business and organisational functions.</p><p><em>The IT Act recognises that the basic responsibility for protecting an entity&rsquo;s information infrastructure lies with the entity itself</em>. It envisages the possible threats to the digital ecosystem during its use and provides direction and guidance for its protection. Relevant Rules have been framed under the IT Act to enable designated national nodal agencies like NCIIPC and CERT-In to oversee, monitor and respond to cyber attacks from malicious threat actors onto the critical information infrastructure (CII) and the national digital ecosystem. There are other Acts and Rules that mandate sector regulators and other authorities to provide regulatory frameworks to secure the critical sectors and build cyber resilience in critical sector entities under their jurisdiction.</p><p>Securing the national cyberspace is a collective effort. The public and private entities that own, run, and manage their information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of the same. The intent of the Government is to ensure that adequate checks and balances are implemented, through appropriate legislations, policies and guidelines, for secure and resilient operations of the critical functions and their underlying critical information infrastructure. The intent of national nodal agencies and sectoral regulators is to ensure that cyber risk is appropriately managed in the sectors, to the level demanded by the national interest.</p><h3 id=structure>Structure</h3><p>The site&rsquo;s documentation section is divided into multiple chapters, sections and topics, covering the perspectives, concerns and needs of different stakeholders within and across critical sector entities and other organisations.</p><p>The Notes, FAQs, Resources and Glossary sections will be populated over time. A Discussions platform is also set up through GitHub for feedback and community engagement.</p><h3 id=context>Context</h3><p>Cyber-attacks on critical information infrastructure by organised criminal groups, non-state and state sponsored groups can cause debilitating impact to national security, economy, public health and public safety. The critical sector entities that own, run, and manage their critical information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of their computer resources (systems, networks, applications, data repositories and identities). The entities are expected and required to use appropriate technology, implement various best practices and build a competent workforce to achieve a high level of cyber resilience.</p><p>The CSEs and other organisations have no dearth of information and guidance from multiple sources to help them secure their IT systems and networks. Yet, a large number of them continue to suffer downtime and losses due to cyber-attacks. An analysis of successful attacks indicate that most of them succeeded because the entities did not or could not apply the cybersecurity information and guidance effectively. A common refrain from cybersecurity experts and auditors is that a large number of entities have negligible or poor implementation of basic and essential cybersecurity controls. It looks as if the entities &ldquo;do not understand&rdquo; or &ldquo;do not want to implement&rdquo; cybersecurity.</p><p>Interaction with business leaders, managers and the non-IT workforce of entities provides a different perspective. The underlying message from these interactions is that they are unable to integrate cybersecurity into their way of thinking and working &ndash; organisational hierarchy, business impact analysis, roles and responsibilities, practices and processes, management systems, reporting structures, RACI etc. Cybersecurity is seen as a technical function that is best carried out by technology experts.</p><p>Every organisation has a complex mix of internal and external workforce and other stakeholders, each having their own specific roles, functions, backgrounds, competence and limitations. However, everyone understands the concept of <strong>business resilience</strong> and can therefore grasp the concept of <strong>cyber resilience</strong>. Hence, it would be appropriate to convert cybersecurity discussions into cyber resilience discussions, to enable the participation of all stakeholders. This calls for</p><ul><li>A <strong>common vocabulary</strong> that business and technical stakeholders can both use to clearly communicate their respective perspectives, both orally and in writing, without ambiguity and misunderstanding, A shared understanding leads to faster and better convergence of perspectives and improving the decision process at all levels.</li><li>A <strong>cyber resilience framework</strong> that harmonises business, IT and cybersecurity perspectives, as also government and regulatory guidelines, directives and global best practices.</li></ul><p>This site attempts to address the two aspects mentioned above. It provides a common vocabulary through a <a href=/docs/glossary/index.html>glossary of terms and definitions</a> that both business and technical users can understand and use. The chapters, sections and topics address different aspects of cyber resilience framework in a harmonised manner, covering institutional structures, people, policies, procedures, practices and processes, technology and collaboration.</p><p>Many of the insights and perspectives are derived from the practices and processes adopted by organisations having a high level of cybersecurity capability and maturity. Organisations should take this documentation as a generic framework that is further adapted for their specific requirements.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>

The external context of an entity includes the customers/ users of an entity’s services, as well as the suppliers, auditors and supporting agencies. In the case of regulated entities and CSEs, the national bodies, viz. the government, regulators, nodal agencies, and other authorities, are important stakeholders/ interested parties, having legal, regulatory, oversight and advisory responsibilities over the entities.</p><p>In modern business, it is very rare that an entity operates in isolation. Besides the customers and users and national bodies, the regulated and critical sector entities provide or use the services of other external entities in a cooperative, coordinated, or federated manner. In addition, the entities also connect with their suppliers and service providers by means of various “channels” and operate using a variety of federated business processes. This business ecosystem is termed in this documentation as <strong>functional business ecosystem of an entity</strong>.</p><p>The business ecosystem of an entity can also be described in terms of the use of IT in the provisioning and consumption of business services, the underlying business processes and information flows between the entity and its users, customers, partners, service providers and national bodies. This technology ecosystem is widely applicable in today’s digital environment and is termed in this documentation as <strong>federated digital ecosystem of an entity.</strong></p><h4 id=federated_digital_ecosystem>Business and Digital Ecosystems</h4><p>The business and digital ecosystems of an entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:</p><p><a href=#R-image-bee96d60304078ecb366f44aa25c30b5 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Federated Digital Ecosystem" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/ecosystem/context/federated_digital_ecosystem.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The organisations however must be aware and responsive to the information security needs of other participating entities within the federated ecosystem, and comply with directions, guidelines and standards prescribed by law, regulation, and mandates of nodal agencies. Every organisation in the complex, federated ecosystem is ultimately responsible for carrying out due diligence, not only about its own information security but also with respect to all parties in its external context.</p><h4 id=national_cyberspace>The National Cyberspace</h4><p>The federated digital ecosystem is a manifestation of the national cyberspace. A pictorial view of the national cyberspace is shown below:</p><p><a href=#R-image-8076d5c5646c12ddaa9734209f7a6f96 class=lightbox-link><img alt="National Cyberspace" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/ecosystem/context/national_cyberspace.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

Ownership, management and control of elements of the digital ecosystem are important criteria to assess the trustworthiness and risk associated with the elements, specifically from the perspective of external threats.</p><h3 id=decomposing-the-ecosystem>Decomposing the Ecosystem</h3><p>The business and digital ecosystems of critical sector entities are highly complex and continually evolving. However, for ease of understanding, they can be decomposed into the following four levels:</p><ul><li>Governance</li><li>Business</li><li>Technology</li><li>Physical</li></ul><p>The pictorial <a href=/docs/ecosystem/context/index.html#federated_digital_ecosystem>ecosystem</a> is further decomposed into the four levels and described in greater detail.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

CSEs, additionally, have to adhere to regulatory, administrative and legal compliances that are mandated for their respective sectors.</p><p>Many small and mid-sized CSEs do not have in-house expertise and competence to design, implement, operate, manage and support a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) program and would depend on external consultancy organisations for the same. Highly regulated sectors like Banking and Financial Services have a well-developed ecosystem of GRC consultancy organisations, certification and audit bodies. Regulators of other critical sectors like Power and Telecom are also developing GRC focused ecosystems for their respective entities. The <a href=https://www.nciipc.gov.in/documents/CAF/Book_Accreditation-Scheme_COs_v.P_31.03.2024.pdf rel=external target=_blank>NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for Consultancy Organisations</a> has two GRC-specific workheads, namely WH-1 and WH-4. The CSEs can use the services of accredited Consultancy Organisations for these Work Heads. The regulators can use the Scheme for development of GRC ecosystems for their respective sectors.</p><h4 id=federated_digital_ecosystem_business_level>Business Level</h4><p>The business level ecosystem of a critical sector entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:</p><p><a href=#R-image-a3cc92f4d3b7468a2e59394eaf4a570a class=lightbox-link><img alt="Business Level Ecosystem" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/ecosystem/context/federated_digital_ecosystem_business_level.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

However, the complexities of technology and information infrastructure are not well understood by them and it is left to the CIOs, CISOs and their teams to handle the same. In most cases the technical and project teams adopt a technology-driven approach, which leads to misalignment between the business needs and the use of digital ecosystem technologies.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices important"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-bolt"></i>

Usually, this work is carried out by their OEMs, System Integrators and other service providers. Thus, these third-party suppliers become an extended workforce of the entities. Automation agents and bots further provide an hugely scalable non-human workforce that can supplement the limited human workforce. However, the CSEs need competent technical personnel within their extended workforce to manage and secure the agents and bots.</p><p>Entities must ensure that their entire <strong>composite workforce</strong>, comprising of own employees, contracted manpower, and third-party suppliers have the required competence (knowledge, skills and expertise) to do their job functions efficiently and effectively. Entities are encouraged to use the NCIIPC-QCI Schemes for <a href=https://www.nciipc.gov.in/documents/CAF/Book_Personnel-Certification-Scheme_vF_v.P_31.03.2024.pdf rel=external target=_blank>Cybersecurity Professionals</a>, <a href=https://www.nciipc.gov.in/documents/CAF/Book_Accreditation-Scheme_COs_v.P_31.03.2024.pdf rel=external target=_blank>Consultancy Organisations</a> and <a href=https://www.nciipc.gov.in/documents/CAF/Book_Accreditation-Scheme_TBs_v.P_31.03.2024.pdf rel=external target=_blank>Training Bodies</a> to assess the competencies and capabilities of their composite workforce. The identified gaps in competencies must be filled up by the concerned HR teams through resources hiring, training and certification.</p><p>CSEs are mandated to adopt the guidelines and directives from national nodal agencies like NCIIPC and CERT-In. They also have well-defined reporting obligations to these agencies. The regulators and national nodal agencies also have an important role related to third-party cybersecurity audits of CSE&rsquo;s information infrastructure. VAPT and audits carried out by CERT-In empanelled auditors, risk assessments carried out by NCIIPC and special audits carried out under the aegis of the NCSC, together provide vital insights about the cyber resilience of CSEs.</p><p>Many CSEs believe the external VAPT and audits are sufficient by themselves and they do not have to carry out their own internal VTR assessments and audits. This aspect is further analysed in other parts of the documentation.</p><h4 id=federated_digital_ecosystem_physical_level>Physical Level</h4><p>The physical level ecosystem of a critical sector entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:</p><p><a href=#R-image-cfd150a7cb90db3f1f9bcad6f067d6b7 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Physical Level Ecosystem" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/ecosystem/context/federated_digital_ecosystem_physical_level.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

Typically, in many CSEs, IIoT technologies like digital access control and CCTV systems are used for securing the physical space. However, these systems are not under the ambit of the more competent technical teams under the CIO and CISOs. The top management of CSEs must therefore involve their IT and cybersecurity teams in the design, implementation, operation, protection and monitoring of their physical security systems.</p><p>Chapter XI of the <a href=https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/notification/2024/08/Draft_CEA_Cyber_Security_in_Power_Sectyor_Regulations_2024_English_Version.pdf rel=external target=_blank>draft regulations</a> published by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) gives specific directions to <a href=/docs/glossary/terms/index.html#responsible_entities_cea>Responsible Entities</a> of the Power sector on the physical security of all identified cyber and non-cyber critical assets.</p><p>Many of the physical processes that OT systems control have the potential to create hazardous situations to human life and safety, property, and the environment. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) is a framework of actions that organisations having OT must take to ensure the protection of the environment without harming the health and safety of their employees or local communities. Manufacturers, implementers, operators, maintainers and regulators of OT systems typically give the highest priority to HSE at the physical level.</p><p>There are several types of safety systems related to OT environments, which typically use instrumentation systems that operate at the physical level for activities like emergency shut down (ESD), process safety shutdown (PSS), and fire and gas systems (FGS). One of the more well-known types of safety system is the safety instrumented system (SIS).</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>

The glossary is divided into the following sub-sections, to align with the ecosystem levels:</p><ul><li>Conceptual terms</li><li>Governance terms</li><li>Business terms</li><li>Technology terms</li><li>Other terms</li></ul><p>The Conceptual terms provide basic definitions and interpretations for all stakeholders. Notes are added under each term to help the stakeholders apply it correctly to the context in which it is being used.</p><p>The Governance and Business terms help the business leadership and management to have a common vocabulary while engaging with other stakeholders at these levels.</p><p>The Technology terms help the technical stakeholders to use a common vocabulary. For example, almost all the interactions at the Technology level between the CSEs, OEMs, service providers and the national nodal agencies are technical in nature. The common vocabulary helps to avoid misunderstanding between the stakeholders.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>

However, when the outcome of technical analysis has to be conveyed to the stakeholders at the Governance and Business levels, the technical teams must use appropriate terms like business functions, business impact, risk, compliance, protection from harm and so on.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=capability-framework>Capability Framework</h1><p>The capability framework for the nation&rsquo;s digital ecosystem describes the people, processes and technology related capabilities in a manner that is agnostic of specific products and solutions. It enunciates the IT and information security capabilities that the digital ecosystem participants should acquire, maintain, and continually improve so as to achieve their objective of cyber resilience. It also describes how organisations can ensure the effective use and sustenance of IT and information security capabilities through a lifecycle approach.</p><p>The target audience for the capability framework includes:</p><ul><li><p>Business and GRC Heads, CIOs, Heads of OT, CISOs and their respective teams within CSEs.</p></li><li><p>Sectoral Regulators, who are mandated to oversee and ensure the cyber resilience of business and IT practices in their regulated entities.</p></li><li><p>Consultancy Organisations, System Integrators, OEMs, MSPs and MSSPs engaged by the CSEs.</p></li><li><p>Empanelled bodies, who carry out cyber security verification & validation (V&amp;V), VAPT and technical audit of systems and networks of CSEs.</p></li></ul><p>Governing bodies and top management of entities (through the Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning Group, the IT, OT and Information Security Divisions) can use this guidance to use, secure and sustain their IT for delivery of business functions, operations, and services.</p><h3 id=smart-resilient-and-sustainable-digital-ecosystem>Smart, Resilient and Sustainable Digital Ecosystem</h3><p>In the current information age, data and communication technologies along with smart devices are deeply integrated into almost all aspects of our lives. The nation today runs on well-orchestrated and integrated IT and is therefore critically dependent upon the cyberspace and its underlying infrastructure (systems, networks, applications and data). Hence, it is vital that the Indian cyberspace is secure and protected against cyber-attacks that could jeopardise the benefits it offers to national security, economic prosperity, governance, constitutional processes, and social well-being.</p><p>The integration of IT at the sectoral, regional, and national levels will only increase in future. Hence, at the national level, there is need to develop capabilities for a <strong>smart, resilient, and sustainable federated digital ecosystem</strong>. These terms are described below.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Smart</strong>: describes the high levels of automation, analytics and decision support capabilities that are enabled by the use of IT. In the context of information and cyber security, these capabilities are typically achieved by the use of intelligent devices, analytics, AI and machine learning for preventing, protecting, detecting and responding to cyber-attacks on IT and OT. Smart technologies can significantly improve the functioning, performance and resilience of the digital ecosystem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resilient</strong>: ‘Resilient’ describes the ability of the business and IT ecosystems to not only withstand large scale attacks and mitigate its destructive power but also the capability to recover from a successful attack in the shortest possible time with minimal damage or disruption. It is a key component of business and organisational needs and achieved through well-designed operating procedures, processes, and practices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainable</strong>: ‘Sustainable’ describes the ability of the critical sector entities and the nation as a whole to be able to use and sustain IT for delivery of national critical functions and business services efficiently and effectively over a long period of time that extends into decades. It can be achieved through a combination of institutional structures, people, policies, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) mechanisms.</p></li></ul><h3 id=terms>Terms</h3><p>The following terms establish a common vocabulary for communication of capabilities, objectives, activities and outcomes. They may be used within the organisations, from the executive level to the operations level, and with external stakeholders for business and technology level communication.</p><p><strong>Information Technology (IT) capability</strong> is described as an organisation’s ability to identify IT business needs, to deploy IT to improve business process in a cost-effective manner, and to provide long-term maintenance and support for IT-based systems.</p><p><strong>Information Security (IS) capability</strong> is defined as “an organisation’s ability to carry out a set of inter-related cybersecurity functions to secure, protect, defend and sustain its mission and business functions that run on underlying IT and OT infrastructure in the cyberspace”.</p><p><strong>Cyber resilience</strong> is a key outcome expected from a full-fledged capability development program. A smart, resilient, and sustainable federated digital ecosystem is achieved at the national level only when all the stakeholders achieve a minimum level of cyber resilience through their individual capability development initiatives.</p><p><strong>Functions</strong> represent sets of management and technical activities that organisations must carry out daily or periodically to achieve their <strong>cyber resilience objectives</strong>. The objectives are described using action-verbs defined below. Organisations can implement the functions through institutionalised practices and processes that must be carried out by the workforce, enabled by technology and tools.</p><h4 id=management_functions>Management Objectives and Activities</h4><p>The action verbs describing the five management objectives are <strong>Govern & Administer</strong>, <strong>Acquire & Provision</strong>, <strong>Operate & Maintain</strong>, <strong>Analyse & Investigate</strong>, and <strong>Train & Enable</strong>. Activities to achieve the management objectives are usually owned, managed and carried out by different units and departments across the organisation.</p><h4 id=technical_functions>Technical Objectives and Activities</h4><p>The action verbs describing the five technical objectives are <strong>Identify</strong>, <strong>Protect</strong>, <strong>Detect</strong>, <strong>Respond</strong> and <strong>Recover</strong>. Activities to achieve the technical objectives are usually owned, managed and carried out by the IT, OT, IIoT and IS workforce of the organisation.</p><p>The technical objectives are derived from NIST CSF, and the guidelines issued by multiple regulators and national agencies. There are minor variations in the definitions of the action-verbs by these different bodies, which can lead to confusion and misunderstanding in conversations between the practitioners of different guidelines. Hence, it is suggested that the definitions given in this document be used as the base for generic discussions.</p><h3 id=description-of-functions>Description of Functions</h3><p>A diagrammatic representation of the technical and management functions is given below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-fd21ebb5981537c3b96ca8fd1e024b50 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Cybersecurity functions" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/ecosystem/capability/cybersecurity_functions.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

Note</summary><div class=box-content><p>The scope of each function in this document is kept short and focused, specifically to help the non-technical users from being overwhelmed.</p></div></details><h4 id=identify>Identify</h4><p>This technical function addresses the need for organisations to identify things of value that need to be secured and protected from harm. The key practices and processes under this function are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Asset lifecycle management</strong>: Identify and catalogue all physical and software assets, both in-store and in-use, across their asset lifecycle from purchase till decommissioning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Information and data lifecycle management</strong>: Identify and catalogue all organisational information and data, along with parameters that help define their sensitivity, organisational value, ownership, restrictions etc, across the information and data lifecycle from creation till disposal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identity lifecycle management</strong>: Identify all individuals, systems, and applications along with their roles, privileges, credentials, and access rights (to assets, information, and data) across their active lifecycle from onboarding till retirement.</p></li></ul><p>The Identify function is a continuously running activity and needs regular review and update. The data managed through this activity is used by all other functions and is therefore a fundamental pillar of the framework. Automation of data collation and analysis activities under this function would be extremely useful to organisations, depending upon their size, budget, and risk profile.</p><h4 id=protect>Protect</h4><p>This technical function addresses the need for organisations to establish and maintain robust defences by continuously searching for, discovering and acting upon vulnerabilties and weaknesses. A robust defensive action minimises the vulnerabilities and weaknesses and reduces the possibility of their exploitation by threat actors. The key processes under this function are:</p><ul><li><p>Protection of in-store and in-use assets spanning across geographies of the organisation’s operational structure. This is typically achieved through hardening of in-use systems, networks, applications, databases, and other components of the information infrastructure, including IoT and IIoT.</p></li><li><p>Protection of data (at rest, in transit, in use) to achieve confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p></li><li><p>Protection of identities of people, machines and devices.</p></li><li><p>Protection of physical premises and safety of OT and IIoT systems.</p></li></ul><p>A layered defence for ICT systems with adequate monitoring and reporting is essential for achieving protection from a large variety of attack vectors. This requires a lifecycle approach that incorporate &ldquo;<strong>secure by design</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>secure in implementation</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>secure during operation</strong>&rdquo;. Custom-developed systems and software additionally require to be &ldquo;<strong>secure during manufacture/ development</strong>&rdquo;.</p><h4 id=detect>Detect</h4><p>This technical function addresses the need for organisations to continuously observe, monitor, analyse, detect and classify threats emanating from anomalous events, activities, incidents, user behaviours, policy violations, infrastructure weaknesses, bypass of security controls, failures of security processes etc.</p><p>Continuous monitoring, analysis and detection of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Indicators of Attacks (IoAs) is possible only through a proper collection and management of logs and other artefacts generated by the digital ecosystem.</p><p>The detect function at the organisation level must provide its observations to the central agencies for sectoral and national level situational awareness of potentially malicious activities in the national cyberspace.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>

National agencies have an important role to play in this regard and should implement mechanisms to ensure availability of essential logs (evidence) for carrying out necessary analysis. Automation of evidence recording by the technical functions is critical for rapid and effective incident handling.  </p><p>Entities should also endeavour to maintain voluntary information security sharing policy to enable broader cyber security awareness. Further, lessons from such information shared by other entities must be carefully perused to evaluate influence on internal cyber security functions.</p><h4 id=govern--administer>Govern & Administer</h4><p>This management function addresses the need for organisations to develop policies, practices, processes and oversight mechanisms for governance and administration of people, processes, and systems on a day-to-day and periodic basis. It is based on establishing and maintaining an enterprise cybersecurity program and an ISMS that provides governance, planning, and operations support to the organisation’s cybersecurity activities. It includes practices and processes for planning and design of applicable guidelines and cyber security policies for the cyber-governance program and identification of risk to formulate mitigation strategy. Audit and compliance requirements are also covered under this function.</p><h4 id=acquire--provision>Acquire & Provision</h4><p>This management function addresses the need for organisations to develop policies, practices, processes and oversight mechanisms for acquisition and provisioning of trustworthy systems. It is primarily focused on conceptualisation, design, acquisition, and engineering of secure and trustworthy systems through a project-driven approach. It also includes supply chain risk management, covering systems, software, services, and workforce resources.</p><p>Regulators and national nodal agencies have a role in shaping policies, procedures, and guidelines for CSEs, specifically for acquisition of their critical systems, processes, services, and workforce. National initiatives for trusted supply chains are under design for supporting the CSEs through regulatory mechanisms.</p><h4 id=operate--maintain>Operate & Maintain</h4><p>This management function addresses the need for organisations to develop policies, practices, processes and oversight mechanisms for secure operations and maintenance of systems. It covers the entire gamut of people, processes, systems, and services.</p><p>It is generally observed that many entities assign the IT security functions to their IT workforce, whose responsibilities and primarily in IT operations. It is paramount for organisations to segregate responsibility at working level between IT operations and IT security functions and allocate separate resources for operation and management of IT security functions.</p><h4 id=analyse--investigate>Analyse & Investigate</h4><p>This management function addresses the need for organisations to continually analyse threats and risks and design, develop, test, implement, analyse, and improve the functions, thereby improving the cyber resilience of the organisation. Threat modelling, performance measurement and evidence collection are essential for any analysis to be effective. The evidence collection should also support investigations that may be triggered by multiple events like cyber incident report, new acquisition, observations during internal / external VAPT etc.</p><h4 id=train--enable>Train & Enable</h4><p>This management function addresses the need for organisations to train the IT Operations and IT Security workforce and other employees (users of IT services) in all the above-mentioned functions. The training must consider the next-generation technologies like AI and evolution in the cyber security domain. Workforce enablement is achieved through the development of organisational culture in which the workforce is encouraged to operate as a team, be accountable and empowered to take decisions within their scope of responsibility and authority.</p><h3 id=application-of-capability-framework>Application of Capability Framework</h3><p>There is a generalised relationship between the management functions and the capability framework:</p><ul><li><p>The functions ‘Acquire & Provision’ and ‘Operate & Maintain’ represent the two major lifecycle stages of systems in CSEs. These functions will help the CSE to become &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, efficient and effective over time.</p></li><li><p>The functions ‘Analyse & Investigate’ and ‘Train and Enable’ will help enhance the CSE&rsquo;s organisational culture for developing &ldquo;resilience&rdquo; through continuous improvement.</p></li><li><p>The ‘Govern & Administer’ function encompasses everything and enables the CSEs to have a long term &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; approach.</p></li></ul><h4 id=elements-of-resilience-and-sustainability>Elements of Resilience and Sustainability</h4><p>In general, cyber resilience is achievable through well-designed operating procedures, processes, and practices, while sustainability is achievable through a combination of institutional structures, people, policies, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) mechanisms. High levels of cyber resilience and sustainability are largely achievable using technology and automation operated by skilled personnel. These are further described below.</p><h5 id=resilience-drivers>Resilience Drivers</h5><p>In the context of cybersecurity, resilience is usually achieved through:</p><ul><li><p>well-designed cyber secure architecture that incorporates the concepts of defense-in-depth and supports the processes and people responsible for its protection.</p></li><li><p>responsive operating practices and processes to achieve resilience, such as:</p><ul><li><p>keep the defenses and all possible attack routes under 24 x 7 watch (Logging, SOC).</p></li><li><p>quick response to anomalous activities that are observed by the SOC (IR).</p></li><li><p>rapidly carrying out defensive actions against materialized attacks (EDR, XDR, SOAR).</p></li><li><p>mitigate the impact of any successful penetration through the defenses (CCMP, BCP).</p></li></ul></li><li><p>a skilled and trained workforce is essential for successfully executing the operating processes.</p></li></ul><h5 id=sustainability-drivers>Sustainability Drivers</h5><p>In the context of cybersecurity, sustainability is usually achieved by:</p><ul><li><p>having the right cybersecurity policies in place.</p></li><li><p>smart mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of implementation and operation of the policies on ground.</p></li><li><p>a culture of continuous improvement within the entities.</p></li></ul><h4 id=strategic-program-management>Strategic Program Management</h4><p>Resilience and sustainability of IT and Information Security are strategic goals of organisations. Hence, they must be driven by the top leadership and management, who must take a long-term strategic view of both the use of IT to achieve business objectives and use of Information and Cyber Security to protect IT and business. Governing bodies and top leadership should assess whether they have adequate in-house capabilities to strategise on these two goals or they require external expertise to support their leaders and teams.</p><p>A <strong>smart, resilient, and sustainable</strong> federated digital ecosystem is achieved only when it is driven by the top leadership. It is a good practice to have a <strong>strategic program management team</strong> that regularly consults, analyses and reports to the top management whether the organisation&rsquo;s digital ecosystem sufficiently:</p><ul><li>Enables and supports the business requirements.</li><li>Protects information and information infrastructure in cyberspace.</li><li>Minimises weaknesses, vulnerabilities and risks through defensive actions.</li><li>Detects failures and cyber exploits.</li><li>Responds rapidly and effectively to IT and cyber incidents.</li><li>Recovers quickly from disruptions and cyber-attacks with minimal damage.</li><li>Is governed, administered, engineered, operated, maintained and managed by a competent workforce, through institutionalised practices and processes, supported by technology, platforms and tools.</li></ul><p>A right combination of people, processes, technology and governance is essential for organisations to leverage the digital ecosystem to accomplish the organisation&rsquo;s mission, fulfil the legal and regulatory requirements, maintain the day-to-day functions, and protect the assets and individuals.</p><h4 id=capability-maturity-models>Capability Maturity Models</h4><p>This is described in detail <a href=/docs/frameworks/cmm/index.html>here</a>.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article></section><article class="chapter narrow"><header class=headline></header><div class=article-subheading>Chapter 2</div><h1 id=organisation>Organisation</h1><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Organisation</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=internal-context>Internal Context</h1><h3 id=operational_structure>Operational Structure</h3><h4 id=business-units>Business Units</h4><p>In the modern business and operational context, information technology has become a key business enabler. It is frequently the case that business units, also called line units, generate their own business requirements, consume external IT services, or get systems dedicated to their own units.</p><h4 id=departments>Departments</h4><p>Departments, also called staff units, perform staff functions to support the entity’s mission. In the context of IT and Information Security, most staff functions are performed through multiple departments with complex interdependencies. Some of the departments involved in a typical CSE for smooth delivery of these functions are:</p><ul><li><p>Administration department manages personnel and physical security.</p></li><li><p>Finance department manages the procurement.</p></li><li><p>Workforce (HR) department ensures that people have the right competencies and critical positions are always staffed by candidates with the right mix of skills and experience.</p></li><li><p>Legal and Corporate Governance department manages legal and regulatory compliance.</p></li><li><p>Internal Audit department provides an independent view of compliance of processes and people.</p></li><li><p>Technical functions related to IT are carried out by the IT Department </p></li><li><p>Information Security related functions are carried out by the Information Security Department.</p></li></ul><p>It is also well-established that Information technology is a key enabler for non-IT staff functions. The functional requirements of various departments are typically enabled through IT. The IT department is usually responsible for the design, development and/ or procurement, implementation and deployment, operation and management of the IT infrastructure, operations, and support. The departments themselves focus on the usage side of IT, covering the users, applications, and data.</p><p>Further, the Information Security Department usually works closely with the IT and the Legal and Corporate Governance Departments as part of its responsibility and accountability towards the governance, risk, policies, compliance, and assessment of information security of the entity’s IT infrastructure.</p><h4 id=sites-and-locations>Sites and Locations</h4><p>Large enterprises are typically spread across multiple sites or geographical locations, typically referred to as remote or branch offices. Sectors such as Power and Energy have OT Sites in the form of substations and regional command and control centres. Enterprises with such geographically separated ICTs must ensure governance mechanisms and controls for the holistic cybersecurity of the entity.</p><h3 id=organisational_structure>Organisational Structure</h3><h4 id=board-of-directors>Board of Directors</h4><p>The Board of Directors of CSEs is ultimately accountable for cybersecurity in the organisation and its responsibilities would include:</p><ul><li><p>approving strategic goals, business objectives, and policies related to IT, Business Continuity, Information Security, Cyber Security, and Cyber Crisis Management, </p></li><li><p>approving the cyber risk appetite as part of the overall risk appetite,</p></li><li><p>approving and overseeing the cybersecurity programme, strategy, and policy to manage cyber risks,</p></li><li><p>ensuring the implementation of the cybersecurity program,</p></li><li><p>being aware of and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory obligations related to cyber security risks,</p></li><li><p>supporting the culture of awareness of cybersecurity in the organisation,</p></li><li><p>allocating adequate budget and resources for fulfilling cybersecurity requirements.</p></li></ul><p>The Board of Directors of the CSEs should set up appropriate board level and other high-level empowered committees for the purpose of Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security to support both strategic and operational goals while addressing the unique risk and compliance requirements in these areas. The governance structures should be kept in mind while framing these committees. Board should have independent director with substantial IT expertise in managing / guiding information technology initiatives. Further technically competent members should be there in the Committees formed. </p><p>In case, any CSE doesn’t have a Board of Directors, then it would be the responsibility of the top management or executive leadership to set up appropriate high-level empowered committees for the purpose of Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security and ensure their effective functioning.</p><p>CSEs having “Protected System” are mandated to constitute an Information Security Steering Committee (ISSC) under the Chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer/ Managing Director/ Secretary of the organisation as per the Information Technology (Information Security Practices and Procedures for Protected System) Rules, 2018 notified vide Gazette Notification S.O. 2235(E) dated 22 May 2018.   </p><h4 id=top-level-management>Top-Level Management</h4><p>The top management of entities, led by the Chief Executive (Managing Director or CEO) is accountable to the governing body (or Board) with respect to the effective and efficient use of Information, Communication and Operational Technologies and Information Security. Most entities usually have permanent leadership roles, with teams under them, that constitutes enterprise-level top management. Typical leadership roles in a CSE are Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Chief of Operations/ Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) and, if required by law, a Data Protection Officer (DPO).</p><p>Top-level management&rsquo;s responsibilities in CSEs will centre around strategic alignment, value delivery, risk management, resource optimization, and stakeholder engagement to leverage IT for competitive advantage and sustainable business performance.</p><p>The essential top-level management functions for Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) and Information Security Governance (EISG) are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Aligning IT and infosec goals and objectives with the overall business strategy and vision set by the Board of Directors</strong>. This involves</p><ul><li><p>setting objectives and initiatives in line with the overall business goals.</p></li><li><p>establishing governance structures by creating committees and steering groups to oversee the alignment between business, IT and cyber resilience.</p></li><li><p>establishing entity-wide policies and programs.</p></li><li><p>ensuring stakeholder involvement.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Providing leadership, direction and oversight for the IT and Infosec departments.</strong> This includes defining the IT operating models, planning, organising and implementing projects to achieve the desired business outcomes, budgeting, organisational structure, roles and responsibilities, and project management oversight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resource Management</strong> - This entails ensuring optimal allocation and utilization of IT and infosec resources (e.g., personnel, technology, budgets), capacity planning, developing strategies for internal and external sourcing of IT and infosec services and solutions, exercising oversight on contracts with third-party service providers, outsourcing of work to Managed Service Providers (MSP), etc. Adequate resources should be designated specifically for cybersecurity, separate from those allocated for general IT needs. Allocation of such resources may widely vary based on the business objective and risk management of each CSE. However, based on global best practice, it is recommended that at least 10% of the total IT budget should be allocated to cybersecurity. This should progressively increase as per the cybersecurity risks faced by the entity. Such allocation should be mentioned under a separate budget head for monitoring by the Board of Directors, Governing Body</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk Management</strong> - This involves</p><ul><li><p>establishing a risk management framework that identifies, assesses and mitigates risks associated with the use of technology, and ensures compliance with the relevant laws, regulations, and policies.</p></li><li><p>analysing and managing the business impact of degradation, failure and non-availability of IT, OT and IIoT systems, and safety of operational technologies (OT).</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring and measuring IT performance and value delivery</strong> - This involves</p><ul><li><p>maintaining oversight using management systems for all IT, OT and Information Security aspects that can adversely affect the organisation.</p></li><li><p>establishing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) for IT and infosec services and activities.</p></li><li><p>using performance data to drive continuous improvement in services and processes.</p></li><li><p>benchmarking to compare IT and infosec performance against industry standards and best practices.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Fostering effective communication, collaboration and partnership between business and IT stakeholders.</strong> Communicate regularly within and outside the entity to ensure coherence. This is especially important during crisis management related to high-impact IT and cybersecurity incidents.</p></li></ul><p>The Enterprise Information Security Governance (EISG) functions are usually led by the CRO or the Enterprise CISO, who is responsible for the implementation of enterprise-wide information security policies, and exercising information security-related oversight on the business groups and business units of the enterprise.</p><p>A CISO should have knowledge and experience of information security governance, risk and compliance management, ISMS and related issues. The CISO&rsquo;s responsibilities typically includes cyber resilience and cybersecurity planning, development and rollout of ISMS, coordinating the cyber security related issues within the organisation and with relevant external agencies. The CISO must be capable of performing the duties as per “Roles and Responsibilities of CISOs” as defined by NCIIPC, CERT-In and Regulators.</p><p>CSEs must clearly define the roles, responsibilties and teams for governance of enterprise IT and information security, as appropriate to their organisational structures. The leadership and teams must be given the required authority and resources to carry out their functions and held accountable for the required outcomes. A key factor for success is the ability of the leaders, their teams, business units and departments to work collaboratively to address the shared concerns of all stakeholders. Adequate thought must be given to behavioural aspects and conflict resolution mechanisms while assigning responsibilities to leaders and teams. Further, each team must have a proper mix of expertise and experience and should use technology to carry out the functions effectively.</p><h4 id=committees>Committees</h4><p>Entities usually have different formal and semi-formal structures to support the governing body and the top management in their IT and information security governance functions. These structures are in the form of committees, groups, task forces etc, and typically carry out evaluation, monitoring, and oversight functions to support the governing body and the top management.</p><p>Many Sectoral Regulators have prescribed the frameworks for the Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security for their regulated entities. The governance frameworks and governance related guidance of the important regulators of the country emphasise the need to have a good governance framework for enterprise IT and Information Security of entities using ICT for achieving their business mission and objectives.</p><h4 id=information-security-division-department-isd>Information Security Division/ Department (ISD)</h4><p>The ISD of an entity is responsible for planning, implementing and continually improving the technology-driven capabilities, processes, and workforce to achieve cybersecurity.</p><p>Each business group or unit in the CSE may have its own ISO (Information Security Officer) and a team under him who may hierarchically report to the CISO. Together, they constitute the entity’s Information Security Division/ Department with appropriate resources and manpower based on the size and business of the CSE.</p><h4 id=technology-strategy-and-perspective-planning>Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning</h4><p>All modern enterprises use technology to carry out their business functions. A good practice followed by many organisations is to have a Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning (TS&amp;PP) programme for planning, implementing and continually improving the technology-driven capabilities, processes, and workforce.</p><p>The technologies and processes are typically deployed through individual projects that are conceived, designed, and implemented by different business units and departments. In many cases, this leads to duplication or inadequate optimisation of enterprise resources, operations, and workforce utilisation.</p><p>The use of IT, OT and Information Security should therefore be evaluated, directed, and monitored from an entity-wide perspective that enables the governing bodies and top management to holistically evaluate the achievement of mission and business objectives. This will ensure that the individual IT, OT and IS projects of different business units and departments are aligned with the enterprise’s strategic IT and Information Security objectives and compliant with all enterprise policies and processes. Further, it helps in the optimisation of investments, IT and cybersecurity workforce competency development, exploitation of the latest technologies and practices, continuous improvement of cybersecurity maturity etc. </p><p>Organisations will benefit from having an entity-wide TS&amp;PP programme that provides enterprise-wide strategic direction and decisions on the use of IT, OT, and information security. The CTO, CIO, Heads of OT and CISO should be a part of Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning committee. Typically the committee should</p><ul><li><p>evaluate the objectives and expected outcomes of different projects within the overall technology adoption roadmap of the organisation.</p></li><li><p>synergise activities and investments across multiple projects.</p></li><li><p>provide oversight and guidance to individual project management teams.</p></li><li><p>oversee the cyber resilience aspects.</p></li></ul><h4 id=performance-and-effectiveness-monitoring>Performance and Effectiveness Monitoring</h4><p>Governing bodies and top management should have a well-defined mechanism for monitoring and measurement of IT, OT and Information Security performance and effectiveness of management systems and processes at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. The monitoring and measurement mechanism should cover all processes, both automated and manual, with the objective of providing actionable evidence to take preventive and corrective actions at each level.</p><p>Metrics are tools designed to enhance the performance and accountability through collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant performance related data. Metrics in information security track the achievement of set goals and objectives by measuring the degree to which security measures are applied, as well as assessing the controls&rsquo; efficiency and efficacy, evaluating the sufficiency of security measures, and pinpointing potential areas for improvement. Entities should develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for evaluation of their IT and Information Security programmes and periodically evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of their IT and Information Security Governance programmes by measuring the defined KPIs.</p><p>Organizations will benefit significantly from having a Performance and Effectiveness Monitoring (P&amp;EM) programme to assist the governing bodies and top management in their function of enterprise-wide monitoring and measurement of IT, OT and infosec performance and effectiveness. The Governance, Risk and Compliance team should work with the business units, IT, OT and Infosec Heads and other stakeholders to develop KPIs that monitor and measure vital aspects of IT, OT and Information Security processes, people and technologies. The KPIs should address the concerns of the governing body and top management.</p><p>CSEs should put in place a structured process of reporting cybersecurity related matters to the Board or the Board Level Committees through the CISO. Structured reporting should inter alia include, key cyber risks faced by the organisation, cyber security preparedness, cyber security postures, organisational initiatives to enhance the cyber security resilience, status of compliance with regulatory guidelines, reporting of cyber security events and incidents.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=governance>Governance</h1><p>Organisational governance is defined as &ldquo;a system by which an organisation makes and implements decisions in pursuit of its objectives.&rdquo; Organisational governance is achieved by a mix of standards, rules, processes, practices, and technology platforms that support maturity in governance.</p><p>In view of enhanced role of ICT for achieving the business mission and objectives, governance of IT and information security are considered as a subset or domain of organisational (entity) governance. Definitions of governance in specific context of IT and Information security are provided in ISO/IEC 26000, ISO/IEC 38500:2015<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> and ISO/IEC 27014:2020<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Governance of Enterprise IT</strong> (ISO/IEC 38500:2015) deals with resources required to acquire, process, store and disseminate information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enterprise Information Security Governance</strong> (ISO/IEC 27014:2020) deals with assurance of information confidentiality, integrity and availability and effective communication of the same with various external stakeholders.</p></li></ul><h4 id=governance-of-enterprise-it>Governance of Enterprise IT</h4><p> A model for good governance of IT shall assist those at the highest level of the entities to understand and fulfil their legal, regulatory and other obligations in respect of their entity’s use of IT.  Further it assists governing bodies to ensure that the use of IT contributes positively to the performance of the organisation. Governing bodies should exercise their authority to ensure that their organisations follow a well-defined and suitable model for governance of IT, based on global best practices, to ensure that the risks arising from the use of IT can be managed and opportunities can be exploited.</p><p>ISO/IEC 38500:2015 describes the principles and practices for good governance of IT and provides a baseline for each entity to develop their own model. The six core principles are:</p><ol><li><p>Establish responsibility.</p></li><li><p>Define strategy for IT to support business.</p></li><li><p>Make acquisitions as appropriate.</p></li><li><p>Ensure performance.</p></li><li><p>Ensure conformance.</p></li><li><p>Achieve appropriate human behaviour.</p></li></ol><p>Further, three main practices through which the governing bodies can continuously evolve governance of IT are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Evaluate</strong> the current and future use of IT in the context of the business need.</p></li><li><p><strong>Direct</strong> preparation and implementation of strategies and policies to ensure that use of IT meets business objectives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitor</strong> performance against the strategies particularly regarding their business objectives and conformance to external obligations and internal work practices.</p></li></ol><h4 id=governance-of-information-security>Governance of Information Security</h4><p>Governance of information security ensure effective implementation of information security controls and provides the following assurance:</p><ul><li><p>Directives concerning information security will be followed.</p></li><li><p>The governing body will receive reliable and relevant reports about information security related activities.</p></li></ul><p>The framework for governance of information security will assist the governing body to make decisions concerning the strategic objectives for the organisation. It further provides information about information security that can affect these strategic objectives. It also ensures that information security strategy aligns with the overall objectives of the entity.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27014:2020 defines six objectives for information security governance that provide a baseline for overall direction and control by the governing bodies and the top management. The detailed description of each objective and process is given in the ISO document. The practical application of each objective within an entity is briefly described below:</p><h5 id=1-establish-integrated-comprehensive-entity-wide-information-security>1. Establish integrated comprehensive entity-wide information security</h5><p>Objective 1 calls for the establishment of an integrated comprehensive entity-wide information security framework. In practice, this would generally be addressed as under:</p><ul><li><p>Organisations should define and document an enterprise level context for their Information Security Management System (ISMS). Further, the context, scope, external elements etc. of each of their individual ISMS implementations (business-unit or site-based) should flow from and be fully aligned with the enterprise context.</p></li><li><p>Organisations should define and document an enterprise level ISMS objective and policy. The ISMS policies of each of the individual ISMS implementations should be aligned with the enterprise context.</p></li></ul><p>An enterprise level approach would provide the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Governing bodies and top management can evaluate, direct, and monitor that information security is consistent across the enterprise.</p></li><li><p>Regulators and national nodal agencies can validate that the policy directives and regulatory guidelines provided to the regulated and critical sector entities are incorporated into the enterprise level ISMS framework, which further gets applied uniformly into all the ISMS implementations in the entities.</p></li><li><p>Auditors can easily assess and verify whether all the mandated policies have been incorporated in each of the ISMSs audited by them.</p></li></ul><h5 id=2make-decisions-using-a-risk-based-approach>2. Make decisions using a risk-based approach</h5><p>Objective 2 calls for using a risk-based approach for decisions. A risk-based approach is recognised world-wide as an effective mechanism for inter-se prioritisation of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Investment in protection functions that includes business continuity.</p></li><li><p>Allocation and use of resources.</p></li><li><p>Work related to tracking and monitoring functions.</p></li><li><p>Incident response and crisis management activities.</p></li></ul><p>In general, risk is a function of impact and likelihood. However, entities may decide that the potential impact of some of the disruptions are so devastating that they have the highest risk even if their likelihood is very low. In all other cases, risk reflects the organisation’s ability to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfil its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals.  </p><p>Regulated and critical sector entities would benefit from using the ISO, IEC, NIST and other well-known standards to design, develop and implement risk management system within their organisations. A risk-based approach helps entities correctly identify all the controls that are applicable in their ISMSs.  An enterprise level approach to risk management would provide the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Governing bodies and top management can evaluate the information security risks with the use of IT to achieve business objectives and further incorporate them into the enterprise level ISMS framework. This will help them direct and monitor the individual ISMSs effectively.</p></li><li><p>Regulators and national nodal agencies can validate that all the additional controls prescribed by them are consolidated into the enterprise level ISMS framework, which further gets applied uniformly into all the ISMS implementations in the entities.</p></li><li><p>Cybersecurity auditors can use the comprehensively defined Statement of Applicability (SoA) to verify that all risks have been considered for their technical audit.</p></li></ul><h5 id=3set-the-direction-of-acquisition>3. Set the direction of acquisition</h5><p>Objective 3 calls for setting the direction of acquisition of IT, OT, and Information Security capabilities in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</p><p>The enterprise level risk assessment carried out as part of Objective 2 will help in the prioritisation of investments and allocation of resources. The Information Security Steering Committees (ISSC) of critical sector entities can provide right guidance to the top management when there is a common understanding of risk.</p><h5 id=4ensure-conformance-with-internal-and-external-requirements>4. Ensure conformance with internal and external requirements.</h5><p>Objective 4 calls for ensuring conformance with internal and external requirements.</p><p>One of the objectives of regulators and national bodies is to standardise information security management and its audit across various entities, particularly the critical sector entities. A common approach and methodology of audit of IT Security can be achieved through the guidelines given in various national / international standards.</p><p>Entities should evaluate and adopt an internationally accepted methodology for audit of the implemented IT and Information Security Management System at agreed frequency and scope (this frequency and scope should be compliant with the minimum baseline promulgated vide various rules and regulations). The audit scope, audit objective, audit criteria and the competency of the auditors should be such that it provides adequate assurance to the stakeholders on the objectivity and impartiality of the results. The results of the audit are to be reviewed at an appropriate level in the entity / controller / regulator. The causal analysis and corrective action plan for any non-conformities observed in the audit are also to be reviewed and tracked for acceptable closure.</p><h5 id=5foster-a-security-positive-culture>5. Foster a security-positive culture</h5><p>Objective 5 calls for fostering a security-positive culture, which is largely a people-driven activity. This requires the top management to focus on building a positive information security culture within the entity through security education, training and awareness programs and integrating the information security responsibilities into the roles of employees and managers.</p><h5 id=6ensure-the-security-performance-meets-current-and-future-requirements-of-the-entity>6. Ensure the security performance meets current and future requirements of the entity</h5><p>Objective 6 calls for ensuring that the security performance meets current and future requirements of the entity.</p><p>A data-driven analytical approach for security performance monitoring and measurement would be highly beneficial for entities. This approach requires entities to identify and use software applications and automation platforms for data acquisition, evidence collection and analysis of both IT and information security performance. The acquired measurement data would help the internal, external, and special audit teams to review and assess the information security processes and activities.</p><p>National nodal agencies can further evolve platforms and processes for machine-processing of data from different entities to carry out sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis of audit compliance, audit effectiveness and grading of auditors. </p><p>The governing bodies and the top management may apply following four main processes repetitively to achieve the above objectives:</p><ol><li><p>Evaluate</p></li><li><p>Direct</p></li><li><p>Monitor</p></li><li><p>Communicate</p></li></ol><h4 id=essential-top-level-management-governance-functions>Essential Top Level Management Governance Functions</h4><p>The key processes for governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security are depicted in the pictorial below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-3bcd6ac8f98612b6b85df8b8fe4b309d class=lightbox-link><img alt="Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/organisation/governance/governance-of-IT-and-IS.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

The focus of governance of IT is on managing resources to acquire, process, store and disseminate information (this may include OT and IIoT). This functionality is complemented by the governance of Information Security, which focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (including the safety of OT and IIoT).</p><p>The governing bodies and top management of all regulated and critical sector entities are accountable for the Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security. They have the responsibility to evaluate and direct the specific actions required to implement the principles within their organisations and monitor their efficacy. In short, Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security are board-level agendas.</p><p>Communication is an important Information Security governance process since it enables entities to be held accountable to interested parties. As part of this function, the critical sector entities must maintain continuous information flow with the national nodal agencies and the sectoral regulators. This communication is necessary for the national nodal agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of their risk management and information security management.  The entities are also required by law to report information security incidents to appropriate national nodal agencies and regulators, as applicable.</p><p>Assurance aspect is overseen by the sectoral regulators and the national nodal agencies bodies, who exercise their authority to audit the regulated and critical sector entities for compliance to law, regulation and directives issued by them.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that, while the authority for specific aspects of IT and Information Security may be delegated to managers within the organisations, the accountability for effective, efficient, and acceptable use of IT and Information Security within the entity and all its organisations remains with the governing body and top management in case of CSEs. This responsibility and accountability cannot be delegated.</p><p>The governance of enterprise IT and information security in the internal context (within the jurisdiction of the entity) is fairly straightforward. All entities typically implement their IT, OT and IS infrastructure to align with their business functions. The operational structure is usually in the form of business units, departments, sites/ branches, and locations. The organisational structure is closely aligned with the operational structure in the form of a governing body or board, top or executive management, senior, middle-level, and lower-level management.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:38500:ed-2:v1:en rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:38500:ed-2:v1:en</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27014:ed-2:v1:en rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27014:ed-2:v1:en</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Governance</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=information-security-management-system-isms>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h1><h3 id=isms-design-implementation-and-operation>ISMS Design, Implementation and Operation</h3><h4 id=overview-and-purpose>Overview and Purpose</h4><p>All organisations recognise the need to protect their business functions, capabilities and processes from being disrupted or compromised. It requires the resilience to be built into the governance, business, technology and physical levels. Organisations use mechanisms like information security management systems (ISMS), incident response (IR), business continuity management systems (BCMS) and cyber crisis management plans (CCMP) to implement and manage the required resilience.</p><p>Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a generic term to describe the practice of protecting an organisation&rsquo;s business functions from disruptions and compromise, and to ensure compliance to laws and regulation. Critical sector entities with notified CII/ Protected Systems are mandated under IT (NCIIPC) Rules, 2018, to setup and operate an ISMS in their organisations.</p><p>All the business functions and processes run on an underlying <a href=/docs/glossary/terms/index.html#glossary_information_infrastructure>information infrastructure</a>. An ISMS can assure the resilience of an organisation&rsquo;s information infrastructure.</p><p>Organisations have an option to design, implement and operate their own custom-built ISMS. However, most organisations implement their ISMS based on published standards like IS/ISO/IEC 27001 or QCI CSMS Level 1. The latter option gives them the benefit of independent third-party certification by an accredited Certification Body (CB).</p><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
Tip</summary><div class=box-content><p>It is advisable for an organisation to start its ISMS journey with a custom-designed, standards-agnostic ISMS. This approach will trigger a deep application of mind on the governance, business and technical objectives and the desired outcomes from the ISMS without being constrained by any specific framework. If required, Section 4 of ISO 27003 can be used for basic guidance and direction. Once the standards-agnostic ISMS design is accepted by the governing body and the top management, the ISMS implementation team can work on using an appropriate standard for implementation.</p></div></details><p>Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) design, implementation and operation refers to the approach that organisations must adopt to protect their IT, OT and IIoT information infrastructure and keep them resilient against cyberattacks. The practice involves identifying risks to the information infrastructure of the organisation, designing policies and controls to mitigate and manage these risks, and implementing the same within the organisation.</p><p>A crucial part of this practice is about regular reviews and updates to keep up with evolving security threats. Consistent review and improvement of an organisation&rsquo;s ISMS practice not only secures the information infrastructure but also supports the organisations&rsquo; regulatory compliance and business continuity.</p><h4 id=isms-governance>ISMS Governance</h4><p>Governing bodies and top management of entities must direct the ISMS to be based on organisational reqirements and have an entity-wide perspective. They have the responsibility to evaluate the requirement of one or more ISMSs to support the information security objectives of the entity. Section 5 of ISO 27003 provides guidance for leadership functions. Section 6 of ISO 27003 and ISO 27005 provide guidance for risk related functions. Section 7 of ISO 27003 provides guidance on providing resources for implementation and operation of ISMS.</p><p>The governing body should undertake the following with due diligence for the success of ISMS:</p><ul><li><p>Mandatorily define and document an enterprise-level context for ISMS in their organisations.</p></li><li><p>Approve the creation of ISMS.</p></li><li><p>Mandatorily define and document an enterprise-level ISMS objective and policy. It should provide directions to each ISMS implementation in the organisation to align it with the enterprise context.</p></li><li><p>All policy and regulatory directions received from and national nodal bodies and the regulators should be incorporated into the enterprise-level ISMS policy. This will help auditors assess whether all the policies have been incorporated.</p></li><li><p>Take decisions on acceptable levels of residual risk or appropriate risk treatments.</p></li><li><p>Provide each ISMS with communication channels and authority to inform interested parties and all persons in the scope of that ISMS.</p></li></ul><p>Plans to obtain ISMS certifications must be formulated at the enterprise level. Obtaining certifications for individual sites, without having an entity-wide plan will be inefficient and ineffective because the individual ISMSs would not be aligned with the entity’s information security objectives, policies and processes and risk management.</p><p>The governing bodies and top management of entities must also monitor the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS during the operational stage to keep it aligned with the organisation&rsquo;s objectives.</p><h4 id=conformance-to-standards>Conformance to Standards</h4><p>ISMS based on ISO 27001:2022 or NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme offer significant benefits in terms of documentation and guidance.

The ISMS design and implementation team must understand the business functions and processes of the organisation and their interdependencies.</li><li><strong>Policy Development</strong>: Design comprehensive security policies that address the protection of information assets against various threats and establish security objectives.</li><li><strong>Roles Definition</strong>: Assign clear information security roles and responsibilities, ensuring accountability and proper oversight of the ISMS initiatives.</li><li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Find, assess, and handle risks according to the set standards.</li><li><strong>Control Selection</strong>: Choose appropriate security controls from the relevant frameworks to mitigate identified risks.</li><li><strong>Control Implementation</strong>: Deploy security measures and practices in alignment with the established ISMS policy framework, supporting the organisation&rsquo;s security strategy.</li><li><strong>Automation</strong>: Evaluate and select software applications and platforms for operating and managing the ISMS processes (documentation, risk, SoA mapping, evidence collection, compliance tracking etc).</li><li><strong>Employee Training and Awareness:</strong> Combine regular security awareness programs with skill enhancement training to educate employees about ISMS policies and improve their ability to contribute to the organisation&rsquo;s security.</li><li><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: Oversee the ongoing effectiveness of the ISMS and security controls, adapting to new threats and organisational changes.</li><li><strong>Regular Audits</strong>: Implement a schedule of internal and external audits to ensure continuous compliance with ISMS requirements and identify opportunities for improvement.</li><li><strong>Improvement Actions</strong>: Address non-conformities and areas of weakness identified during reviews and audits, closing gaps in the ISMS where necessary.</li></ul><h4 id=isms-implementation>ISMS Implementation</h4><p>Each ISMS must implement controls for information security risk treatment in accordance with the policies approved by the governing board / top management of the CSE. ISO 27003 provides explanation and guidance for implementing all requirements of ISO 27001.</p><p>Generic steps for implementing ISMS based on ISO 27001:2022 or NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme are given below:</p><ol><li>Set the scope of ISMS by defining what parts of the organisation’s information systems are intended to be protected. The scope typically includes the organisation’s business processes and locations that will be covered under ISMS.</li><li>Establish and publish a top-level Information Security policy for the organisation. This will be further supported by subordinate policies.</li><li>Set the Risk Assessment context as per the requirements stated in Clause 4 to Clause 10 of ISO 27001:2022. Use ISO 27005 and various other guidelines for risk assessment.</li><li>Identify and evaluate risk as per Clause 6 and Clause 8 of ISO 27001:2022.</li><li>Establish a Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC) for the organisation, which should be approved by the top management of the organisation (Board or Board equivalent). The RAC will then be used as the basis for risk management (assessment, evaluation, and treatment).</li><li>Set the risk acceptance threshold, based on the context of the organisation and the expectations of internal and external interested parties.</li><li>Formulate the risk treatment plan in respect of the RAC by selecting appropriate controls from &ldquo;Annex A of ISO 27001:2022&rdquo;. Add supplementary and technical controls from external sources (e.g. guidelines and directives from Ministries, Regulators, NCIIPC, CERT-In, NSCS) and global good practices (e.g. PCI, CIS, Cloud Security Alliance) if they are considered necessary or suitable in the business context of the organisation. Use ISO 27002:2022 as a working guideline for meeting the requirements of ISO 27001:2022.</li><li>Document all the applicable controls along with their point of application in a Statement of Applicability (SoA) document. Any control, if excluded, should be justified in the SoA and the same should also comply with the risk acceptance criteria.</li><li>Implement the security controls given in the SoA on the information infrastructure. Typically, two-tier control deployment, viz primary control and supervisory control is adopted to mitigate the critical risks.</li><li>Carry out an audit or inspection of the information infrastructure through CERT-In empanelled auditors, covering both process and technical deployment of controls, as per the guidelines issued by CERT-In and NSCS.</li><li>Test the effectiveness of implementation and operation of cyber security technical controls through the mechanism of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VA & PT)</li></ol><p>ISMS flowchart is pictorially represented below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-2c99e447d2f4cbef2b5736a9fb868201 class=lightbox-link><img alt="ISMS Flowchart" class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/organisation/governance/isms/isms_flowchart.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

Reporting to the governing body and top management is essential to the success of ISMS.</p><p><strong>IS/ISO/IEC TS 27008:2019</strong> provides guidance on reviewing and assessing the implementation and operation of information security controls. It includes the technical assessment of information system controls and their compliance to criteria established by the organisation, law and regulation.</p><p>Another critical aspect of ISMS operation is to measure the outcomes delivered by it. <strong>ISO/IEC 27004</strong> provides detailed guidelines for evaluating the information security performance and the effectiveness of an ISMS.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Clause 9.1 requires the organisation to evaluate the information security performance and the effectiveness of the ISMS. It requires the organisation to determine:</p><ul><li>what needs to be monitored and measured (systems, processes and activities).</li><li>the methods for monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation.</li><li>when the monitoring and measuring shall be performed.</li><li>who shall monitor and measure.</li><li>when the results from monitoring and measurement shall be analysed and evaluated.</li><li>who shall analyse and evaluate these results.</li></ul><p>The ISMS operation must generate output for various attributes of the implemented controls that can be used to measure the efficacy of the controls, such as:</p><ul><li>the degree to which a control reduces the likelihood of the occurrence of an event.</li><li>the degree to which a control reduces the consequence of an event.</li><li>the frequency of events that a control can cope with before failure.</li><li>how long after the occurrence of an event does it take for the control to detect that the event has occurred.</li></ul><p>Measurable data from systems and processes is generated continuously in the form of event logs, metrics, traces and audit trails. These measures must be collected and analysed as frequently as possible. However, the reporting of such measures may be scheduled as per the needs of the interested parties.</p><p>For example, while data on security incidents is collected continually, internal reporting to higher levels of management will depend on the defined polices, such as severity (possibly requiring immediate notification as in the case of a reportable breach) or aggregated values (as might be the case for attempted intrusions which were detected and blocked). Similarly, reporting of cybersecurity incidents to external interested parties like regulators, CERT-In, sectoral CERTs and NCIIPC, will be based on their respective directives.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27001:2022 also requires the organisation to retain appropriate documented information as evidence of the monitoring and measurement results.</p><h5 id=metrics>Metrics</h5><p>Some of the possible metrics for continual improvement of ISMS are listed below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Key Performance Indicators</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of Security Incidents</td><td>Count of unwanted events that could endanger the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information.</td></tr><tr><td>Security Control Audit and Review Frequency</td><td>Measures the number of times security controls are reviewed and audited.</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Findings</td><td>The number of critical findings or unresolved issues from audits.</td></tr><tr><td>Delay in Scheduled Audits</td><td>Measures the percentage of scheduled audits and reviews that are not completed within their planned timeframes.</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Non-Compliance Issues</td><td>Track the number of identified non-compliance issues during the audit with legal and regulatory requirements</td></tr><tr><td>Effectiveness of Security Controls</td><td>Tracks the percentage of risks successfully prevented, detected, and mitigated.

There are many software platforms that can monitor the ISMS activities and generate reports for various levels of management. The software platforms also provide a record of ISMS activities that the audit teams can use as evidence. Work is also being done to create human and machine-readable formats such as the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) for automated management of ISMS controls.</p><p>Periodic inspection and audit of ISMS of CSEs is a time-consuming activity. The regulators and national bodies can also create platforms and processes for machine-processing of ISMS data from the CSEs, which will also help in sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis of audit compliance and non-compliance issues, audit effectiveness, grading of auditors etc.</p><h4 id=isms-practice-owners>ISMS Practice Owners</h4><p>A sample matrix of responsibilities is given below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Activity</th><th>Primary Ownership</th><th>Collaborative Role</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Establish and review the ISMS strategy.</td><td>ISSC</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr><tr><td>Oversee the development of ISMS policies and procedures.</td><td>CISO</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr><tr><td>Maintain the ISMS documentation and control mechanisms.</td><td>Information Security Team</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Ensure ISMS compliance with legal and regulatory standards.</td><td>GRC Team</td><td>Legal Team</td></tr><tr><td>Implement controls, standards and guidelines emanating from the ISMS implementation and design programme.</td><td>IT/OT Ops Team</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Conduct ISMS awareness and training programs.</td><td>HR Team</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr><tr><td>Monitor and report on ISMS performance using KPIs/KRIs.</td><td>GRC Team</td><td>IT/OT Ops Team</td></tr><tr><td>Manage ISMS auditing and continual improvement.</td><td>Internal/External Audit Team</td><td>Information Security Team</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=nciipc-guidelines>NCIIPC Guidelines</h4><details open class="box cstyle notices important"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-bolt"></i>

The Dev-Sec-Ops and CI/CD pipeline used in software development lifecycles are examples of modern process automation. Automation frameworks are also being developed for content-based processes such as governance, risk, compliance, audit, information sharing and AI/ML enabled decision support.</p><p>CSEs can improve the efficiency of its workforce significantly by using standard operating processes (SOPs) for routine jobs and employing technology to run the standardised processes. Enabling manpower with technology to meet IT and IS, is strongly recommended.</p><p>To achieve automation and workforce enablement, it is essential for an organisation to have suitable manpower with adequate enablement through training, technology, and availability of resources to undertake jobs at levels as mentioned below:</p><ul><li><strong>Operating Level</strong>: This is the basic workforce of most Organizations that is capable of “doing things” at the operating level.</li><li><strong>Operational Analytics Level</strong>: Competent workforce with capability to analyze issues at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels and suggest mitigation measures. This workforce needs IT-enabled analytical support tools to demonstrate reliability and efficiency in their operations.</li><li><strong>Design Level</strong>: This level requires experienced specialists with skills and competence to design the operating and analytical processes and configure the platforms, to execute them.</li></ul><h5 id=automation-in-cti-sharing>Automation in CTI Sharing</h5><p>The critical success factors for cyber resilience and sustenance of the nation’s digital ecosystem are:</p><ul><li>The speed and quality of detection of compromise and cyber-attacks within the entities.</li><li>The rapidity by which information and guidance is disseminated to all the actual and potential targets.</li><li>The speed and effectiveness of response within entities as well as across sectors and cross-sectors.</li></ul><p>Conventional paper-based and email-based methods of sharing are not capable of achieving the required speed in information sharing amongst all the stakeholders and participants, since they are less amenable for automated processing. Use of standardised STIX, TAXII and TLP protocols (or equivalent protocols) is a recommended for sharing CTI with speed and objectivity to counter cyber-attacks. Details of such protocols are covered in <a href=/docs/frameworks/protocols/index.html>protocols section</a>.</p><p>Community-driven MISP platform and OASIS STIX/TAXII protocols with TLP based classification is considered well suited for the Indian IT ecosystem at this stage. A coherent approach is required for adopting TLP, MISP and STIX/ TAXII as the core elements for operational cybersecurity information sharing. Standardisation in this aspect can help achieve balance between speed (with ambiguity or inaccuracy) and correctness (with delays) in sharing of CTI.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=workforce>Workforce</h1><h3 id=organisational-structure>Organisational Structure</h3><p>Workforce responsible for IT, OT, IIoT and Information Security within organisations can be generically divided into four levels of hierarchy, as given below.

Given the size and complexity of IT, OT, IIoT and cybersecurity ecosystems, the CSEs and other organisations usually have a <strong>composite workforce</strong> which is a mix of own employees, contracted workforce, resources of SIs, OEMs, ISVs, Partners, consultants, MSPs, SaaS and other service providers, who work together to carry out the organisations’ activities and tasks. A must have practice for an outsourced workforce is to have senior and middle-level managers of the organisation oversee the outsourced work.</p><p>Cybersecurity practices and processes can map across multiple cybersecurity support functions due to the interconnected nature of cybersecurity operations, where different aspects of a process may support various functions simultaneously. Considering the interconnected nature of cybersecurity activities, entities should assign the primary ownership and support roles to the activities related to each practice/ process.</p><p>Primary ownership indicates the team or role with overall responsibility for executing a particular cybersecurity process or function. The primary team or role is accountable for the required outcomes and decision-making. The support (collaborative() role identifies the supporting teams or roles that contribute to the overall objectives of the practice or process. They may be required to provide necessary data, analysis, or assistance to ensure the process&rsquo;s success.</p><p>The top and senior management of CSEs may use well-known mechanisms like RACI matrix to outline the roles and responsibilities of individuals and teams. The primary owners must be clear about their responsibility and accountability while the collaborative teams and roles must know what support is expected from them.</p><p>It is essential that the top and senior management clearly communicate the overarching objectives of cybersecurity and how each team’s efforts contribute to them. Cyber resilience can be enhanced when there is a shared sense of purpose and reduced friction between teams that usually arises due to overlapping or conflicting purposes.</p><p>Organisations will accrue significant benefits if their workforce understands the end goal of the practices and processes, and how the activities and tasks help or harm the accomplishment of the goal. Training and enablement of the workforce should focus on this aspect so that the workforce has a clear understanding of their ownership and responsibility for achieving the objectives.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article></section><article class="chapter narrow"><header class=headline></header><div class=article-subheading>Chapter 3</div><h1 id=frameworks-and-standards>Frameworks and Standards</h1><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Frameworks and Standards</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=enterprise-architecture-framework>Enterprise Architecture Framework</h1><p>Enterprise Architecture is a discipline that provides a holistic and integrated view of an organisation’s strategy, processes, information, and technology. This enterprise approach enables the alignment of various components of the business to work cohesively towards common goals. Within the Enterprise Architecture Framework, ‘enterprise’ can be understood in two key contexts:</p><ul><li>The broad spectrum of the enterprise, inclusive of all people, processes, and technology</li><li>A particular domain within the enterprise, such as a specific business unit or functional area.</li></ul><p>In both scenarios, the architecture spans multiple of systems and encompasses numerous departments within the organisation. When the objective is to create a cohesive network that includes the extended enterprise, it involves not only the internal divisions but also external entities such as partners, suppliers, and customers.</p><p>The aim of enterprise architecture as a framework is to optimise the often-fragmented legacy of processes across the enterprise (both manual and automated) into an integrated and secure environment that is responsive to changes and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy.</p><p>This section provides a reference framework to governing bodies and top management of regulated and critical sector entities to establish ‘due diligence’ on the use of IT in their respective entities. It describes the Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) at two levels, viz:</p><ul><li>Enterprise Business Architecture Framework (EBAF).</li><li>Enterprise Technology Architecture Framework (ETAF).</li></ul><p>The business architecture context is about how the organisation delivers value to its stakeholders. The technology architecture frameworks are about using technology to support the business mission, goals, objectives, and functions.</p><h3 id=enterprise-business-architecture-framework>Enterprise Business Architecture Framework</h3><h4 id=overview>Overview</h4><p>The Enterprise Business Architecture Framework (EBAF) presents an end-to-end methodology that strategically aligns an organisation&rsquo;s goals with its operational activities. Serving as an architectural blueprint, it guides leaders in shaping the processes, systems, and data flows central to the enterprise&rsquo;s functioning. By integrating various components of business—ranging from customer interactions to technological infrastructure—EBAF aims to create an environment that is both streamlined and agile, fostering a business structure that is efficient and swiftly responsive to evolving demands.</p><p>At its core, the purpose of EBAF is to provide a structured yet flexible means for articulating and implementing a business’s architecture that resonates with its strategic imperatives. This involves offering clear guidance for continuous improvement of operational processes, aligning every business move with strategic goals. Beyond merely enhancing operational effectiveness, the framework serves as a catalyst to reduce process redundancies and drive enterprise-wide efficiency, ensuring that all actions taken are deliberate and goal-oriented.</p><p>Incorporating a strong emphasis on security, EBAF also propels organisations to proactively address potential risks and integrate robust security measures into their business architecture. This security-minded approach is essential in safeguarding critical information and systems, ensuring resilience against threats, and maintaining trust with stakeholders. To reinforce business resilience and foster innovation, EBAF pursuits with compliance and governance, permitting the safe exploration of new technologies and practices within a secure architectural landscape. Effectively, EBAF not only ensures that organisations meet regulatory requirements but also establish a secure foundation for growth and transformation.</p><h4 id=the-business-ecosystem>The Business Ecosystem</h4><p>The business ecosystem of an entity describes its environment in terms of its functions and activities in relation to and with the participation of other entities and national bodies. The business ecosystem of an entity can also be described in terms of the use of IT in the provisioning and consumption of business services, the underlying business processes and information flows between the entity and its users, customers, partners, service providers and national bodies.</p><p>Business ecosystem of regulated and critical sector entities in Indian context is pictorially shown <a href=/docs/ecosystem/context/index.html#federated_digital_ecosystem>here</a>.</p><h3 id=enterprise-technology-architecture-framework>Enterprise Technology Architecture Framework</h3><p>The federated digital ecosystem of a CSE is manifested through an information infrastructure that runs the business, industrial and operational processes. Most of the currently available technical literature and knowledge focuses on differentiating the characteristics and technical architectures of IT, OT, IIoT and Information Security systems and networks. In contrast, this documentation attempts to synergise and harmonise the differentiated concepts and frameworks into a common representation that can help in better communication amongst the business, non-technical and technical stakeholders, both within and outside the organisations.</p><p>The enterprise technology architecture framework outlined in this section offers a unified reference for top and senior management of organisations and national nodal bodies. It is designed to facilitate informed decision-making on leveraging technology to achieve desired business results, establish best practices, and provide comprehensive guidance on functional, performance, operational, managerial, and security considerations. It may be noted that the word “technology” here refers specifically to IT, OT, and Information Security related technology, as well as IIoT technology used for physical access control and monitoring (e.g., smart cards, biometrics, CCTVs etc).</p><h4 id=concepts>Concepts</h4><h5 id=requirements-for-use-of-technology>Requirements for use of Technology</h5><p>The enterprise technology architecture framework of organisations should address the following requirements so that IT and OT are used efficiently, effectively, safely and securely:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Functional</strong>: Deliver the business and industrial objectives through functions, processes, operations, and services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quality</strong>: Deliver the required quality of systems and software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Deliver required performance of the functions and processes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>: Assurance that the functionality is implemented and configured correctly and is operating as intended.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: There are no weaknesses and vulnerabilities in hardware/ firmware/ software that could be exploited by malicious actors to cause harm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: The information and data are handled as per its security classification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>: The data and processes are trustable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: The functions and performance are available to the users at required levels of availability. </p></li><li><p><strong>Safety</strong>: Specific to OT and IIoT, the assurance that the operational processes are safe for humans and the environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Privacy of individuals and organisations is maintained, with regard to sensitive and private information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supply chain</strong>: Assurance that the entire supply chain is secure and not exploitable for causing harm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Management</strong>: People, process, and technology governance, which oversees and assures that the above parameters are consistently achieved throughout the life cycle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ecosystem</strong>: The organisation&rsquo;s digital infrastructure does not cause harm to other organisations that are part of the federated digital ecosystem.</p></li></ul><h5 id=architectural-principles>Architectural Principles</h5><p>The IT, OT and IS infrastructure implementation is based upon a common set of engineering and architectural principles, namely:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Zoning of assets, network, and resources (security by design, security in implementation).</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-layered security</strong>: Implementing a layered security cover to achieve defence in depth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Ability to assure a required level of functionality and performance in normal circumstances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>: Ability to deliver a minimum level of functionality and performance in the face of adversity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resilience</strong>: Ability to prevent the degradation of functions, performance, and trustworthiness; ability to minimise the impact of degradation (if it occurs) and ability to quickly recover from a degraded condition to the normal condition.</p></li></ul><h5 id=patterns-of-a-cses-information-infrastructure>Patterns of a CSE’s Information Infrastructure</h5><p>Almost all CSEs implement their information (IT, OT and IS) infrastructure through separate projects.

The <a href=/docs/frameworks/ontology/index.html>ontology for tagging an enterprise’s information infrastructure</a> has three tag-groups, viz <strong>resource categorisation tag group</strong>, <strong>hierarchical level tag group</strong> and <strong>trust level tag group</strong>.</p><p>The ontology is technologically agnostic so that it can understood by both business and technical persons. The tags are meant to be used in architecture diagrams and presentations of business and technical management to describe the use of IT, both for their internal decision processes and for communication with external entities. The tagging enables non-technical personnel to assimilate the context and participate in decision-making.</p><h5 id=resource-categorisation-tags>Resource Categorisation Tags</h5><p>The resource categorisation tags help the stakeholders to represent the ownership and control that an entity has over its information infrastructure elements. The following tags are in this group:</p><ol><li>Resource zones - central (S) or end-user (U).</li><li>In-use resources purpose and use – functional (FS, FU) or governance/ management/ administration (GS, GU).</li><li>Connectivity zones (V).</li><li>Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD).</li><li>Connectivity ownership (VA, VB, VC, VD).</li><li>Connectivity purpose and use (XA, XB, XC, XD).</li><li>End user resource ownership (UA, UB, UC, UD).</li><li>End user role (NU, OU).</li><li>Control over human workforce (WA, WB, WC, WD).</li><li>Services (DC, IS, OS, TS, SS, FM).</li><li>Service ownership (JA, JB, JC, JD).</li><li>Data centre segmentation (ML1 to ML4).</li><li>Cloud services segmentation (YL0 to YL4)</li></ol><h5 id=sample-use-case-for-resource-categorization-tags>Sample Use Case for Resource Categorization Tags</h5><p><strong>Scenario</strong>:</p><p>A CSE wants to implement a new Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) to streamline its IT infrastructure, operations, and governance.</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>:</p><p>The organisation&rsquo;s resources are diverse and distributed across various departments, zones, and functions. The complexity of managing these resources often leads to inefficiencies, lack of clarity in ownership, and difficulty in governance. There is an immediate need for a system that can simplify the categorisation and understanding of these resources for all relevant stakeholders, while also supporting the implementation of the new EAF.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>To address this challenge, the organisation decides to employ a set of resource categorization tags within their EAF. These tags act as labels that allow for easy identification and categorisation of resources, helping stakeholders to better understand the purpose, ownership, governance and threat modelling of each resource within the enterprise infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Resource Zones Tags:</strong> Tags like ‘Central (S)&rsquo; for shared resources and &lsquo;End-User (U)&rsquo; for individual user-specific resources simplify the location and accessibility of resource classification for stakeholders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose and Use Tags:</strong> Tags such as &lsquo;functional (FS, FU)&rsquo; for operational resources and &lsquo;governance/management/administration (GS, GU)&rsquo; for resources related to the oversight and control efficiently distinguish between the functional aspects of resources and their governance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connectivity and Ownership Tags:</strong> Tags like &lsquo;Connectivity zones (V)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD)&rsquo; offer clarity on the connective infrastructure and its proprietors, expediting responsibility allocation and incident resolution.

The IT and OT teams must also be able to converge onto a common representation of their respective hierarchies.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>In addressing these challenges, the organisation opts to implement hierarchical level tags within their EAF. These tags help to classify the information infrastructure into hierarchical zones with assigned trust levels. This tagging enables the stakeholders to clearly segment the IT and OT resources, aiding in threat modelling, risk analysis and the strategic allocation of resources across zones.</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Central Resource Hierarchy Tags:</strong> Tags ranging from ‘Central resource hierarchy of zones (HL0 to HL5)&rsquo; clearly delineate the core infrastructure zones, establishing a graded structure of trust and access controls that escalate with each hierarchy level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perimeter Zone Tags:</strong> &lsquo;Perimeter zones between hierarchical zones (PHL1 to PHL4.5)&rsquo; tags facilitate a distinct border identification between hierarchical zones, serving as checkpoints for security assessments and transitions in trust levels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Centre and Cloud Perimeter Tags:</strong> Tags like &lsquo;perimeter zones in data centre segments (PM1 to PM4)&rsquo; and &lsquo;perimeter zones in cloud environment (PYL0 to PYL4)&rsquo; categorize resources within data centres and cloud segments. These tags help stakeholder teams evaluate and address specific security concerns more accurately within these venues based on the designated trust levels.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Improved Risk Management:</strong> Hierarchical tags aid in identifying and managing potential risks associated with the varying zones, thus enhancing the overall security posture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlined Resource Deployment:</strong> The tags create an organized structure that simplifies the understanding of where resources reside and their respective trust levels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Informed Decision-Making:</strong> Teams gain insights into infrastructure vulnerabilities and strengths, enabling them to make more strategic decisions about resource deployment and protection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Effective Collaboration:</strong> A common classification system assists diverse teams in synchronizing their efforts, thus facilitating collaboration, and reducing inconsistencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Security Profiles:</strong> Each resource carries a clear security profile through tagging, accommodating tailored security measures.</p></li></ul><p>An illustrative use of resource categorisation tags is given below.</p><p><a href=#R-image-0c85d7b899648e798657c416d52505c0 class=lightbox-link><img alt=use_of_hierarchical_level_tags_for_IT class="lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/docs/frameworks/architecture/use_of_hierarchical_level_tags_for_IT.svg style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

This will help the project design and engineering teams, IT and information security operations management teams and the service providers to design, implement, operate and manage zoning, segmentation and zero trust architecture. The following tags are in this group:</p><p>‒         Trust level (TL0 to TL5)</p><h5 id=sampe-use-case-for-trust-level-tags>Sampe Use Case for Trust Level Tags</h5><p><strong>Overview</strong>:</p><p>An organization plans to implement zero trust in its enterprise IT. Stakeholders include IT architects, security officers, network administrators, and management teams who must understand and enforce the security policies, zoning and segmentation within the organization&rsquo;s operations effectively.</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>:</p><p>Varied levels of data sensitivity and diverse IT systems across the enterprise create a complex security landscape that requires a clear and uniform approach to managing trust and control levels. Stakeholders require a reliable method for identifying, at a glance, the security trust levels and enforcement strength for each zone to correctly implement and adhere to security policies, controls, and compliance requirements.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:</p><p>Trust level tags serve as a simple and effective way to categorise and label the components of the organisation&rsquo;s resource and connectivity zones based on defined security policies and the level of control the entity has or requires. These tags help stakeholders instantly recognise the importance and sensitivity of each zone, ultimately guiding their risk management and policy enforcement actions.</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Defining Trust Levels:</strong> Categorise and define security trust levels ranging from TL0 to TL5. Establish criteria for each level based on the level of control the entity has/ can have over the zone</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluating and Tagging Resource Zones:</strong> Assess each resource zone within the organisation and determine the appropriate trust level. Apply the respective trust level tag to systems, databases, and networks accordingly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluating and Tagging Connectivity Zones:</strong> Analyse network segments and connectivity frameworks for security enforcement capability and requirements. Assign trust level tags that match their security policy framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>Incorporating into EAF documentation:</strong> Update all related architecture diagrams, policies, and procedural documents with the applied trust level tags to create a standard reference across the organisation, ensuring coherence and mutual understanding among all stakeholders responsible for zero trust.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enhanced Risk Management:</strong> Trust levels guide stakeholders toward adequately securing each zone according to its criticality and the organization&rsquo;s risk tolerance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> The standardized tagging system reduces complexity and eases the communication of security and compliance statuses across departments and teams.</p></li><li><p><strong>Streamlined Policy Enforcement:</strong> Clearly identified trust levels support consistent application of security measures and rapid adjustment to evolving threats.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficient Compliance Monitoring:</strong> Tags make it easier to monitor adherence to internal and external compliance standards, enabling swift corrective measures as needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimized Security Investments:</strong> By identifying zones with higher trust levels, the organization can prioritize security investments and focus resources where they are most impactful.</p></li></ul><p>An illustrative use of trust level tags in a business ecosystem diagram is given below.

The central zones are located physically within the data centres or the local server rooms in regional/ branch offices. These zones are tagged as System or <strong>‘S’ zones</strong>.</p><p><strong>End User Resource Zones (U Zones):</strong> These zones host the in-use operating resources (computing devices, applications, data repositories) of end users and their local networking and security infrastructure. The users may be human or machine and are typically identified by their credentials (user and machine ids) that are linked to centrally managed user and system accounts. The user zones are generally located physically within the office premises of organisations or work/ home premises of remote users. These zones are tagged as User or <strong>‘U’ zones</strong>.</p><h3 id=in-use-resources>In-Use Resources</h3><p>Computer resources (assets) of entities may lie in the store or be deployed for use. The resources deployed and in-use in central and end-user zones can be categorised as under, based on their purpose and use. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘S’ or ‘U’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Resource Use Type</th><th>Resource Use Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FS, FU</td><td>Functional Use</td><td>The resources are used for business functions, services, operations, and analytics.

The connectivity zones are usually owned and managed by TSPs and ISPs and are accessed by means of customer premises equipment (CPE) that are installed in the resource zones connecting to the WAN. These zones are tagged as <strong>‘V’ zones,</strong> say Connectivity Zone.</p><p>The connectivity (V) zone of an entity is, in effect, a resource (S) zone of the TSP and ISP.</p><h3 id=data-centre-ownership>Data Centre Ownership</h3><p>All data centres and server rooms hosting the central resources are categorised as under, based on their ownership. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘S’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Data Centre Type</th><th>Data Centre Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SA</td><td>Entity Owned</td><td>Captive data centres and server rooms owned by the entity.</td></tr><tr><td>SB</td><td>GOE Owned</td><td>Data centres of Govt Owned Entity (NIC, SDCs, PSUs).</td></tr><tr><td>SC</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Data centres of Privately Owned CSP, India based DC facilities.</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Data centres of Privately Owned CSP, multi country DC facilities.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><p>The above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk and compliance aspects of data centre and cloud service providers, while providing strategic direction to the use of IT. For example, the risk of non-compliance of data localisation requirement is higher in the case of Type SD as compared to Type SC.</p><p><strong>Tag SA</strong> entity owned private cloud is exclusive to the organisation, which may be hosted on-premises or in a site hired from a property owner. This corresponds to the pattern where an organisation provides its own captive cloud services.</p><p><strong>Tag SB</strong> GOE owned cloud is typically mandated for almost all the critical business functions of CSEs. Many common services like email, portals, eOffice and other IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS/ DRaaS are provided as cloud services to the Govt Community.</p><p><strong>Tag SC</strong> private cloud service providers with India-only data centres are easily able to comply with data localisation requirements that can be verified using lower levels of audit effort. Such CSP data centres are preferable when data localisation requirement as well as control over data storage outside of India is of high priority.</p><p><strong>Tag SD</strong> private cloud service providers with multi-country data centres include the i) the likes of global CSPs like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle, SAP; ii) OEM service management related to OEM patches, vulnerability feeds and sending system telemetry back to the OEMs, specifically relevant to OT OEM support services that are provided from OEM support cloud installations.; iii) third-party managed services (MSPs and MSSPs) covering both Indian and non-Indian ownership and control; iv) content delivery network (CDN) providers; v) domain name providers, digital certificate issuers, PKI management providers like DigiCert, DNS and other security service providers like Cloudflare etc.</p><p>The key advantages of tag SD CSPs are that they can provide very high levels of infrastructure scaling, availability, and business continuity. A large pool of trained and experienced professionals is also available for such CSPs, and these professionals can be easily hired to manage and secure the zones implemented in these CSP data centres. These CSPs can comply with data residency within the Indian geography but cannot easily prove compliance that data is not also residing outside of India. Significant audit effort is required to verify the same. Hence, such CSP data centres are relevant when an organisation requires very high and dynamic scalability or has to provide its services beyond the national boundaries or when there are no major concerns related to copies of data being stored outside of India.</p><h3 id=connectivity-ownership>Connectivity Ownership</h3><p>These zones host the Wide Area Network (WAN) network provider infrastructure that provide the conduits for voice, video, and data connectivity between the resource zones. These zones are tagged as <strong>‘V’ zones</strong>.</p><p>The connectivity providers are categorised as under, based on their ownership. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘V’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Connectivity Type</th><th>Connectivity Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VA</td><td>Entity Owned</td><td>Captive WAN and mobile networks owned by the entity.</td></tr><tr><td>VB</td><td>GOE Owned</td><td>WAN and mobile networks of Govt Owned Entity (NICNET, NKN, PSUs).</td></tr><tr><td>VC</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Networks of Private TSP/ ISP, managed from India based facilities (Airtel, Reliance, Vodafone-Idea).</td></tr><tr><td>VD</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Networks of Private TSP/ISP managed from outside India. Example, global satellite communication providers.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><p>The above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of connectivity providers (TSPs/ ISPs), while providing strategic direction to the use of IT. For example, the national security risk due to misuse of the monitored traffic patterns is higher in the case of Type VD as compared to Types VA, VB, or VC.</p><h3 id=connectivity-use>Connectivity Use</h3><p>The connectivity can be categorised as under, based on the purpose and use. The tags are derived from the primary tag <strong>‘X’</strong>, to identify the network topography:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Characteristics of Connectivity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>XA</td><td>Closed user group (CUG).</td></tr><tr><td>XB</td><td>Intra-organisation: Intranet (WAN), local area network (LAN), data centre networking (DCN).</td></tr><tr><td>XC</td><td>Inter-organisation: Extranet (WAN).</td></tr><tr><td>XD</td><td>Public: Internet.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Tag XA</strong> is typically used for high security closed user groups, which use captive networks or encryption devices on less secure networks. Entities also use VPN to create closed user groups for privileged users, who typically have to connect to the data centres to provide remote support.</p><p><strong>Tag XB</strong> is typically used for intranet connectivity of regional and branch offices through MPLS Cloud, Leased Lines or Site-to-Site VPNs. This also includes remote OT cells/ areas within an OT Site that typically connect to the OT site operations/ DMZ on wired LAN.</p><p><strong>Tag XC</strong> is typically used for extranet connectivity through MPLS Cloud, Leased Lines or Site-to-Site VPNs. Examples are RBI Infinet, NIC NKN, Power sector grid operation networks between substations and control centres etc.</p><p><strong>Tag XD</strong> is typically used for internet connectivity through wired/ wireless broadband and mobile networks provided by the Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p><h3 id=end-user-resource-ownership>End User Resource Ownership</h3><p>The end user resource ownerships are categorised as under, based on the organisation to which the human user or machine belongs.

The organisation can enforce that the end-user devices must have adequate endpoint protection (AV, anti-malware etc) and comply with organisational policies (patches/ updates, upgrades, password policy enforcement, authorised applications, VPN usage etc). These controls can even be enforced and centrally managed on the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) of remote workers.</p><p>Entities have a lower level of control over tag UB, UC resources that belong to other Organizations. In most cases, the user’s organisation is responsible for configuring, securing, and managing the end user resources. Other organisation’s users (humans and machines) typically connect to one’s own organisation’s information infrastructure through the Extranet. Other organisation users may also connect using IPSEC or SSL VPNs over the Internet. One’s own organisation must depend upon the other organisation’s policies and processes of control over the end-user devices in terms of their endpoint protection and compliance to policies. Formal and established relationships between entities help to increase the trust in the human users and machines of the other entities.</p><p>Entities do not have any control over tag UD resources, the end-user devices of public users, who connect to organisation’s information infrastructure through the Internet, typically using browser or mobile applications. Machine to machine connections from public users/ Organizations to an organisation’s systems are generally API-based.</p><h3 id=end-user-role>End User Role</h3><p>The end user resources are categorised as under, based on the role of the human user or machine.

These include all types of administrators, service accounts, remote support providers etc. Business users with high levels of decision and approval powers can also be called privileged users.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><p>End user zones with privileged users (OU) are a higher risk to the entity than those with normal users (NU) only. Such zones therefore need to be governed and managed with greater focus and may call for increased surveillance and compliance.</p><p>Privileged Users (OU) can be grouped as</p><ul><li>technical persons and machines (administrators, OEM remote support etc).</li><li>business and special users accessing sensitive information (e.g., regulatory & statutory auditors).</li></ul><h3 id=human-workforce-control>Human Workforce Control</h3><p>The human workforce for operating and managing the central resources and connectivity of entities are categorised as under, based on the entity’s level of control on the technical, administrative, physical and IT access control aspects of the workforce.

This is done by the organisation themselves for resource categories WA and WB or by the service provider for resource categories WC and WD. Some Organizations also invest into the technical skill development of their WB resources (contractual employees).</p><p>The administrative functions related to the workforce covers aspects of skill verification and documentation during workforce onboarding, contract management, compliance to laws and regulation. This is done by the organisation itself for its own employees under resource category WA or by the resource/ service provider for resource categories WB, WC, and WD. Some Organizations manage the compensation payments and payment of GST for resource categories WB by themselves, while others let the workforce resource provider do the same.</p><p>The physical and IT access control of the workforce covers aspects of physical entry into the organisation’s premises and places of work within the organisation. It also covers access to IT and OT resources, both on-premises and remotely through the network. All Organizations control the physical access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC. The Organizations also control the IT access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC when they are on the organisation’s premises. In case of remote working of WC and WD category workforce, the service providers decide which person is assigned to remotely manage their customer organisation’s IT / OT infrastructure and further controls the IT access of the assigned resource as per the SLAs signed with the customer organisation.</p><p>The above workforce control categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate and provide strategic direction on the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of i) the workforce employed to operate and manage their central resources in data centres, and ii) the workforce employed by their outsourced and managed service providers (WC and WD).</p><p>For example, the risk of data leakage is higher from those providers of outsourced and managed services (WC, WD), who do not have good due diligence processes to hire, train and monitor their own and contractual employees, or they are further outsourcing the work to second tier service providers. Due diligence is especially important for workforce having privileged user (OU) rights.</p><p>A strategic assessment of the level of control available to an entity with regard to the outsourced workforce (WC and WD) operating and managing its resource and connectivity zones would help the entity identify the SLAs that should be in place with the outsourced and managed service providers. The SLAs should especially cover the control, monitoring, and oversight on the privileged users (OU) of the service providers since these highly skilled users generally work remotely.</p><h3 id=service-ownership>Service Ownership</h3><p>The modern federated digital ecosystem is largely driven by services. In general, a Service Provider Entity (<strong>SPE</strong>) delivers a service to a Customer Entity (<strong>CE)</strong>, who acquires the service. The relationship between the SPE and the CE may be formal, semi-formal or informal, depending upon the type of service agreements that exist between them.</p><p>The services related to IT, OT and Information Security infrastructure are categorised as under:</p><ul><li>Data <strong>Centre Services</strong> (<strong>DC</strong>): These are typically provided by Cloud Service Provider Entities (<strong>CSP</strong>).</li><li>Telecom <strong>and Internet Services</strong> (<strong>IS</strong>): These services include voice, video and data communication services that are provided by telecom and internet service provider entities (<strong>TSP, ISP</strong>).</li><li>Operation <strong>Support Services</strong> (<strong>OS</strong>): These services include NOC, SOC, call centres, customer service centres etc.</li><li>Technology <strong>Support services</strong> (<strong>TS</strong>): These services include L1 to L3 support services and managed services that are usually provided by second- or third-party entities such as OEMs and/or their partners, SIs, MSPs, MSSPs etc. These services are usually contracted with formal service level agreements between the customer (CE) and the service provider entity (SPE).</li><li>Subscription <strong>services</strong> (<strong>SS</strong>): These services include all types of subscriptions and are typically in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feeds, vulnerability, and compliance (SCAP) feeds, open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds, remote health monitoring service etc. These services may either be i) contracted by the CE with formal service level agreements with the SPE, or ii) non-contracted best effort services that have no formal SLAs between the CE and the SPE. The SPEs themselves may be source (feed) owners or feed aggregators.</li><li>Non**-IT Facility Management Services** (<strong>FM</strong>): These services include power supply, site, and facility management (physical security, non-IT infrastructure) services etc.</li></ul><p>In the modern federated digital ecosystem, the SPE and the CE may be different entities by themselves or may be different business units within large Organizations and the Government (e.g. NIC and SDCs are SPEs to govt departments (CEs)).</p><p>The SPEs are categorised as under, based on their ownership and location. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘J’:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>SPE Type</th><th>Service Provider Entity Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>JA</td><td>Entity Owned</td><td>Services owned, managed, and consumed by the entity itself (captive).</td></tr><tr><td>JB</td><td>GOE Owned</td><td>Services owned, managed, and delivered by Govt Owned Entity.</td></tr><tr><td>JC</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Services delivered by Private SPEs from India based facilities.</td></tr><tr><td>JD</td><td>Privately Owned</td><td>Services delivered by Private SPEs from outside India facilities.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Notes:</p><p><strong>Tag JA</strong> SPE corresponds to the pattern where an entity has its own captive services.</p><p><strong>Tag JB</strong> SPEs usually provide DC, IS, OS, TS, SS and FM services by government owned entities to CSEs.</p><p><strong>Tag JC</strong> SPEs deliver their services from India based facilities.</p><p><strong>Tag JD</strong> SPEs deliver their services from outside India facilities.</p><p>The above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of service provider entities, while providing strategic direction to the use of IT, OT, and Information security services. For example, the risk of disruption of service caused by changes in the local country regulations is higher in the case of type JD as compared to type JC, while it is very low for types of JA and JB.</p><p>Many Govt owned SPEs (tag JB) such as CERT-In, NCIIPC, CSIRTS etc provide Cyber Threat Intel feeds that are aggregated and enhanced by them.</p><h3 id=segmentation-of-data-centres>Segmentation of Data Centres</h3><p>It is evident that data centres and server rooms of entities are the most critical elements of an entity’s use of IT for achieving business objectives.</p><p>Data centre premises and contents can be segmented, based on the legal ownership of the i) physical property that hosts the data centre, usually managed by the property manager (FM-SPE), ii) the data centre facility or site itself, including the IT and non-IT infrastructure installed in the facility and owned by the Data Centre Service Provider Entity (DC-SPE), iii) supporting infrastructure of the facility (power, telecom, physical security) provided by the Facility Management Service Provider Entity (FM-SPE), and iv) platforms and services provided by the DC-SPE to the customers and users (CE).

The levels are prefixed with the tag <strong>‘ML’.</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Segmentation Level Type and Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ML1</td><td>Physical property hosting the DC - buildings, civil infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td>ML2</td><td>Physical DC site premises - IT and non-IT infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td>ML3</td><td>Support facilities - power, telecom, physical security</td></tr><tr><td>ML4</td><td>Customer owned resources within the DC – co-located resources and subscribed resources</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In almost all cases, the legal owners are responsible for the operations, management, security, legal and regulatory compliance functions of their segments. They are also responsible for the workforce handling these functions. For example,</p><p><strong>ML1</strong> is owned, operated, managed, and secured by the Property Manager (FM-SPE), who is responsible for ingress/ egress control into the property, campus security and safety. The workforce handling these functions are contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p><strong>ML2</strong> is owned by the DC-SPE and managed by the DC Site Manager, who is responsible for DC operations and management. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the DC-SPE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p><strong>ML3</strong> is owned by the FM-SPE, who are responsible for operations and management of their services. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the FM-SPE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p><strong>ML4</strong> is owned by the Customer Entity (CE), who is responsible for the operations and management of their platforms and subscribed services. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the CE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).</p><p>In the case of entity owned data centres and server rooms (SA), the entity is both the DC-SPE and the CE. In case the entity also owns the inter-data centre and customer connectivity (VA), then the entity is also the IS-SPE for its intranet connectivity facilities.</p><p>In other cases (SB, SC, SD), there is a supplier and acquirer relationship between the DC-SPE and CE regarding the provisioning and use of cloud services. Cloud service customers can also consider multiple cloud service providers together as a cloud services supply chain.</p><p>The IS/ISO/IEC 27036: Part 4:2016 provides guidance on supplier relationship between the cloud service customer (acquirer) and the cloud service provider (supplier). IS/ISO/IEC 27002 clause 15 &ldquo;Supplier relationships&rdquo; provides controls, implementation guidance and other information for managing information security in supplier relationships. IS/ISO/IEC 27017:2015 provides guidelines on information security controls suitable for cloud services provision and usage, that can provide guidance to the DC-SPE and the CE. The DC-SPEs also obtain certification of compliance to various standards that are applicable to cloud services, such as IS/ISO/IEC 20000-1, SOC-2 etc. These standards are described in the compendium.</p><p>As per industry practice, the resource provisioning and orchestration functions are carried out by the DC-SPE. However, the responsibility of operation, management and security of customer subscribed data centre resources is shared between the DC-SPE and CE based on the type of cloud computing model that the CE has subscribed to from the DC-SPE. These are broadly classified into IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, XaaS etc. NIST SP 800-145, SP 500-292, and SP 500-332 provide detail guidance on cloud computing models.</p><h3 id=segmentation-of-cloud-services>Segmentation of Cloud Services</h3><p>The cloud computing resource types given in the table below are adapted from the industry practice in a manner that it can also be applied to entity-owned captive data centres and GOE owned data centres.

Principally, the models must be able to provide insights to some of the concerns of CSEs and national bodies, as listed below:</p><ul><li><p>What are the maturity levels of CSEs in comparison with established benchmarks in governance, risk management, enterprise architectures, system lifecycle management, IT and infosec capabilities, technology implementations, operations and support processes, workforce characteristics?</p></li><li><p>What must be improved?</p></li><li><p>What needs to be measured and assessed to enable improvement?</p></li><li><p>How comprehensive are the enterprise policies, practices and processes?</p></li><li><p>How good is the visibility, oversight, and control across the enterprise on the compliance to policies?</p></li></ul><p>In general, CMMs have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li><p>collect the best practices.</p></li><li><p>are developed by a collaboration of experts from diverse backgrounds.</p></li><li><p>consider the dispersion in size, knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience of organisations that use the model.</p></li><li><p>take a life cycle and continuous improvement approach.</p></li></ul><p>There are prominent capability maturity models in the domains of cybersecurity and SOC operations, which are described below.</p><h3 id=capability-maturity-modelling-cybercmm>Capability Maturity Modelling (CyberCMM)</h3><p>Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Modelling (CyberCMM) is globally acknowledged as a practical and successful approach to measure and improve the cyber resilience of enterprises. It helps organisations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make improvements to their cybersecurity programs. It focuses on the implementation and management of cyber security practices associated with the information technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) assets and the environments in which they operate. A CyberCMM can:</p><ul><li><p>enable organisations to evaluate and benchmark their cybersecurity capabilities effectively and consistently and prioritize actions and investments to improve their cybersecurity capabilities.</p></li><li><p>enable national bodies to share knowledge, best practices, and relevant references across organisations to help them improve their cybersecurity capabilities.</p></li><li><p>enable national bodies to carry out data-driven analytics from sectoral, cross-sectoral and trends-over-time perspectives.</p></li></ul><p>Cybersecurity capability maturity models are typically designed and engineered to provide a self- assessment platform for individual CSEs.

The cybersecurity capabilities of DIB organisations can be rigorously measured using CMMC. This can be used by the DoD to make risk-informed decisions regarding the information it shares with DIB contractors. The CMMC thus helps the DOD in establishing levels of confidenece with regard to the security of defense contractors and the DIB.</p><p>The CMMC framework draws on maturity processes and cybersecurity best practices from multiple standards as well as input from DIB entities and the DoD. It is primarily designed to secure the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) supply chain. The DIB organisations have to be certified by a CMMC third-party assessment organisation (C3PAO) at a particular level prior to bidding on contracts.</p><p>The CMMC defines the following:</p><ul><li><p>a <strong>practice</strong> is a specific technical activity or activities that are required and performed to achieve a specific level of cybersecurity maturity for a given capability in a domain.</p></li><li><p>a <strong>process</strong> is a specific procedural activity that is required and performed to achieve a maturity level.</p></li></ul><p>CMMC version 2.0 Dec 2021 defines 14 domains, three levels with practices for each level for the DIB, as under:</p><ul><li><p>Level 1 – Foundational (level 1 of v1.0) - 17 practices 48 FAR 52-204-21 Oct 2016</p></li><li><p>Level 2 – Advanced (level 3 of v1.0) – mirrors NIST SP 800-171 (110 practices)</p></li><li><p>Level 3 – Expert (level 5 of v1.0) – based on subset of NIST SP 800-172.</p></li></ul><p>The 14 domains are aligned with the families specified in NIST SP 800-171</p><ul><li><p>Access Control (AC)</p></li><li><p>Awareness & Training (AT)</p></li><li><p>Audit & Accountability (AU)</p></li><li><p>Configuration Management (CM)</p></li><li><p>Identification & Authentication (IA)</p></li><li><p>Incident Response (IR)</p></li><li><p>Maintenance (MA)</p></li><li><p>Media Protection (MP)</p></li><li><p>Personnel Security (PS)</p></li><li><p>Physical Protection (PE)</p></li><li><p>Risk Assessment (RA)</p></li><li><p>Security Assessment (CA)</p></li><li><p>System & Comn Protection (SC)</p></li><li><p>System & Info Integrity (SI)</p></li></ul><p>An organisation must meet both the process and practice level requirements to achieve that level of certification within CMMC.</p><h4 id=iec-62443-maturity-levels>IEC 62443 Maturity Levels</h4><p>From an organisational perspective, the IEC 62443 standard series describes four “Maturity Level” ratings (ML 1 – ML 4). The ML rating system is used to evaluate how well an organisation defines and describes security processes and how well the processes are followed by the personnel involved. The maturity levels are distinct from security levels (SL-T).</p><h4 id=cert-resilience-management-model-cert-rmm>CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM)</h4><p>The CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM), developed by the CERT Division of SEI, Carnegie Mellon University defines 26 processes areas grouped into 4 categories - Enterprise Management, Operations Management, Engineering and Process Management.

The CMM is closely aligned with RBI-CSF, which is harmonious with international standards, such as NIST CSF, COBIT 5.0, ISO 27000 and other standards.</p><p>RBI CMM focuses on i) implementation and adoption of the mandated cybersecurity framework uniformly in the financial firms, ii) understanding of the firm’s cybersecurity maturity in terms of the adoption of the regulatory cybersecurity framework, iii) benchmarking, and iv) regulatory tracking.</p><p>The CMM provides guidance through i) a methodical approach to measurement of risk, planning of controls and governance and security strategy execution to strengthen cybersecurity posture of financial firms, and ii) metrics-based treatment, benchmarking and prioritizing risk driven investment in security.</p><h4 id=secure-controls-frameworks-scf>Secure Controls Framework’s™ (SCF)</h4><p>SCF&rsquo;s Cybersecurity & Data Privacy Capability Maturity Model (C|P-CMM) is an undertaking by SCF contributors to define maturity levels for the SCF’s control catalogue. The SCF leverages an existing framework, namely the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model v2.0 (SSE-CMM) and provides control-level criteria to an existing CMM model.</p><h3 id=soc-cmm>SOC-CMM</h3><p><a href=https://www.soc-cmm.com/ rel=external target=_blank>SOC-CMM</a>, evolved from a research project to become a well-used standard for measuring capability maturity in Security Operations Centres. The SOC-CMM model was initially created to determine characteristics and features of SOCs, such as specific technologies or processes. It evolved to become the defacto standard for measuring capability maturity in Security Operations Centers.</p><p>At the core of the assessment tool lies the SOC-CMM model. This model consists of 5 domains and 26 aspects, that are each evaluated using a number of questions. The domains &lsquo;Business&rsquo;, &lsquo;People&rsquo; and &lsquo;Process&rsquo; are evaluated for maturity only (blue colour), the domains &lsquo;Technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;Services&rsquo; are evaluated for both maturity and capability (purple colour).</p><h4 id=maturity>Maturity</h4><p>SOC-CMM is a continuous maturity model, allowing improvements across all domains simultaneously and independently. The SOC-CMM uses maturity stages based loosely on the CMMI:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Non-existent</strong>. At this level, the aspect is not present in the SOC</p></li><li><p><strong>Initial</strong>. The aspect is delivered in an ad-hoc fashion</p></li><li><p><strong>Managed</strong>. The aspect is documented and delivered consistently</p></li><li><p><strong>Defined</strong>. The aspect is managed using ad-hoc feedback on the quality and timeliness of deliverables</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantitatively Managed</strong>. The aspect is systematically being measured for quality, quantity and timeliness of deliverables</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimizing</strong>. The aspect is continuously being optimized and improved.</p></li></ul><h4 id=capability>Capability</h4><p>The SOC-CMM uses a continuous approach to measuring technical capability across the technology and services domains. These can be technical features, such as the existence of certain tooling options or other features such as service artefacts. Capabilities can be expressed at any maturity level. Just like with maturity scoring, capability scoring is continuous. Similar to the CMMI, the SOC-CMM supports 4 capability levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Incomplete</strong>. The capability is missing or lacking essential features</p></li><li><p><strong>Performed</strong>. The capability is performed, but not standardised</p></li><li><p><strong>Defined</strong>. The capability is deliverd in a standardised fashion</p></li><li><p><strong>Managed</strong>. The capability is active managed and improved.</p></li></ul><h4 id=methodology>Methodology</h4><p>The methodology used to create the SOC-CMM is a scientific research approach called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science_research rel=external target=_blank>Design Science Research</a>. This type of research has a focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice and works well for areas that have not been extensively (scientifically) studied and clearly defined, as is the case for SOC capability and maturity. The goal of Design Research is the creation of a tangible result of the research effort. In this case, two artefacts were created: the SOC-CMM model, which is an abstract representation of SOCs and the self-assessment tool based on that model to evaluate capability maturity in a SOC.</p><p>The SOC-CMM self-assessment tool is available for download <a href=https://www.soc-cmm.com/products/soc-cmm/ rel=external target=_blank>here</a>.</p><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=national-guidelines>National Guidelines</h1><p>This compendium of national guidelines for cybersecurity is summarised from the original sources for information only.

Any guidance that is based on IS, ISO, IEC, ITU-T standards provides the following advantages:</p><ul><li><p>These standards are maintained and regularly updated by an international panel of experts, which also has Indian participation.</p></li><li><p>The ISO standards can be easily extended to include any additional requirements, especially those that are defined under the Indian law and regulation, or available in global frameworks like NIST, CIS, CSA etc. </p></li><li><p>The standards can provide a common baseline reference amongst all the NCRF stakeholders, especially in the i) definition and usage of various terms, ii) governance, management, risk, compliance and audit frameworks, iii) implementation and continual improvement approaches, and iv) standardisation of processes related to verification, validation, measurement and audit. The common baseline reference will ensure that the possibility of misunderstanding amongst the stakeholders is minimal.</p></li><li><p>Entities can get their organisations certified against specific management standards. The entities can also procure and use the other guidance and technical standards to help them in maximising the effectiveness during implementation.</p></li><li><p>There will be synergy between the entities and their internal/ external experts, consultants, implementers and auditors, since everyone refers to the same set of standards. In practice, this is already being done with regard to popular standards such as ISO 9000, ISO 27000 and IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>The oversight mechanism of Government bodies, regulators and national nodal agencies is easily harmonised when all bodies adopt a commonly accepted set of standards.</p></li><li><p>There is already a large pool of consultants, implementers and auditors in India, who have the knowledge, expertise and experience in implementing and auditing entities based on these standards. Capacity building of this pool, both in terms of quantity of personnel and quality of expertise, can be taken up through various national and international forums. Both ISO and IEC invest in strengthening the skills of its members, both at the human and the organisational level, through extensive training and technical assistance programmes. The capacity building programmes of ISO and IEC may be explored further.</p></li><li><p>BIS, a member of ISO and IEC, has a mechanism in place for standardisation and supply of standards at reasonable prices within the Indian ecosystem. Similarly, Department of Telecom (DoT) represents India at the ITU-T and QCI is a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), a worldwide association of accreditation bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment. Through these organisations, the Indian Government and ecosystem can maximise the effectiveness of use of globally recognised standards and frameworks.</p></li><li><p>The ISO and IEC are exploring new ways to provide dynamic deliverables that adapt to the needs of users in a much more flexible way. Together, they are developing a common vision for Standards that are Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART)<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>,<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>. The SMART standards will be modular, machine readable, and eventually, machine interpretable and executable. The corresponding Indian Standards can hugely benefit from this initiative.</p></li></ul><p>In view of the advantages listed above, the concepts and guidance have been built upon and aligned with a selected set of IS, ISO, IEC and ITU-T reference standards that are relevant and applicable to the Indian ecosystem. All the stakeholders are encouraged to develop their understanding of the core principles, approaches, methods and processes described in these base set of standards, so that the concepts and guidance can be used effectively. </p><p>The regulated and critical sector entities will benefit significantly if they obtain further guidance from the IS/ISO/IEC and other standards listed below:</p><ul><li><p>Governance of IT and information security, based on ISO/IEC 38500, 27014, COBIT etc</p></li><li><p>Service Management System (SMS) that are typically based on IS/ISO/IEC 20000 family.</p></li><li><p>Information Security Management System (ISMS) that are typically based on IS/ISO/IEC 27000 family, including sector specific standards.</p></li><li><p>ISO 27013 standard that assists organisations in implementing both ISO 27001 and ISO 20000-1 concurrently or in implementing one where another is already in place.</p></li><li><p>OT Security that are typically based on IEC 62443 series.</p></li><li><p>Other standards related to IT asset management, audit etc.</p></li><li><p>Other frameworks such as NIST, CIS, CSA etc.</p></li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html rel=external target=_blank>https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final rel=external target=_blank>https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:5><p><a href=https://www.iso.org/smart rel=external target=_blank>https://www.iso.org/smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:5 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:6><p><a href=https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart rel=external target=_blank>https://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:6 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><section><h1 class=a11y-only>Subsections of Standards</h1><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=lifecycle-management-of-systems-and-software>Lifecycle management of systems and software</h1><p>The <a href=https://www.iso.org/standard/84709.html rel=external target=_blank>ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1:2024 - Systems and software engineering — Life cycle management — Part 1</a> publication provides unified and consolidated guidance on life cycle management of systems and software, complementing the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.</p><p>The standard defines a number of terms that are useful to establish a common understanding amongst the stakeholders responsible for the life cycle management of systems and software.

The AD methodology is useful to specify requirements of various entities, including software, systems, enterprises, systems of systems, families of systems, products (goods or services), product lines, service lines, technologies and business domains. The Architectural Description conceptual foundations<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> are summarised below.</p><h4 id=ad-concepts>AD Concepts</h4><ul><li><p>A <a href=/docs/glossary/terms/index.html#glossary_system><strong>system</strong></a> is situated in an <strong>environment</strong>. The environment of a system may contain other systems. The system’s environment is bounded by and understood through the identification and analysis of the system’s stakeholders and their concerns. The environment determines the totality of influences upon the system throughout its life cycle, including its interactions with that environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholders</strong> have interests in a system, which are expressed as <strong>concerns</strong>. Concerns arise throughout the life cycle from system needs and requirements, from design choices and from implementation and operating considerations. A concern could manifest in many forms, such as in relation to one or more stakeholder needs, goals, expectations, responsibilities, requirements, design constraints, assumptions, dependencies, quality attributes, architecture decisions, risks or other issues pertaining to the system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architecture of a system</strong> constitutes what is essential about the system in relation to its environment (in an abstract form). The term <strong>system-of-interest</strong> is also used to refer to the system whose architecture is under consideration in the preparation of an AD.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architecture descriptions</strong> (AD) are used to express architectures for systems of interest (in a documented form). They include one or more Architecture Views that address the concerns of stakeholders. AD may include information not part of any architecture view. Examples include system overview, architecture rationale etc.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>Architecture Viewpoint</strong> frames one or more concerns and a concern can be framed by more than one viewpoint. Examples of viewpoints are i) business/ mission viewpoint, ii) deployment viewpoint.</p></li><li><p>Each Architecture Viewpoint has exactly one <strong>Architecture View</strong> that expresses the architecture of the system of interest in accordance with the Architecture Viewpoint and addresses the concerns framed by the governing viewpoint. Thus, a viewpoint is a way of looking at systems and a view is a result of applying a viewpoint. Examples of views are i) business/ mission view, ii) deployment view, iii) operations view.</p></li><li><p>Architecture View is composed of one or more <strong>Architecture Models</strong>.

Systems security engineering is a subdiscipline of systems engineering that addresses security-relevant considerations intended to produce secure outcomes.</p><p>In recent years there is a clear recognition that “Systems security engineering must be fundamental to systems engineering. Security fundamentals must be clearly understood by stakeholders and effectively evaluated in a way that considers broad goals with security functions and outcomes.”<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>NIST SP 800-160 Vol 1r1 (Nov 2022) recognises that “building trustworthy, secure systems cannot occur in a vacuum with stovepipes for software, hardware, information technology, and the human element (e.g., designers, operators, users, attackers of these systems). Rather, it requires a transdisciplinary approach to protection, a determination across all assets where loss could occur, and an understanding of adversity, including how adversaries attack and compromise systems. It addresses security issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements and protection needs and the use of established engineering processes to ensure that such requirements and needs are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor across the entire life cycle of the system.”</p><p>This publication describes the security design principles, concepts, and techniques that are part of a trustworthy secure design approach. These can be applied in the development of new capabilities or systems, modification of existing capabilities or systems, and development of system of systems. It is intended to be used by:</p><ul><li><p>Systems engineers, security engineers, and other engineering professionals.</p></li><li><p>Professionals and teams, who perform other system life cycle activities or tasks, such as those listed below</p><ul><li><p>Security governance, risk management, and oversight</p></li><li><p>Security verification, validation, testing, evaluation, auditing, assessment, inspection, and monitoring</p></li><li><p>Acquisition, budgeting, and project management</p></li><li><p>Operations, maintenance, sustainment, logistics, and support</p></li><li><p>Providers of technology-related products, systems, or services</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The core objective of the publication is to be engineering-based, not operations- or technology-based. Organisations can adapt the concepts and principles for trustworthy secure design, the systems life cycle processes and security-relevant activities and tasks described in the publication to achieve consistent security outcomes in the capabilities delivered by their systems.</p><p><strong>System Security Viewpoints</strong></p><p>The publication defines three predominant viewpoints of system security, viz i) system function, ii) security function, and iii) life cycle assets.</p><ul><li><p><strong>System function</strong> is the system’s purpose or role as fulfilled by the totality of the capability it delivers combined with its intended use. Every system is required to satisfy all the stakeholder capability needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security function</strong> is the system’s fulfilment of the stakeholder’s protection capability needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life cycle assets</strong> are associated with the system but are not engineered into or delivered with the system. Life cycle assets typically include intellectual property, data and information associated with the system, and supporting assets for development, production and sustenance of the system. The association of lifecycle assets with the system means that they can be the direct cause of loss or a conduit/means through which a loss can occur.</p></li><li><p>The system function is the predominant viewpoint and establishes the context for the security function and the associated system life cycle assets.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Systems Security Engineering Framework</strong></p><p>The systems security engineering framework provides a conceptual view of the key contexts within which systems security engineering activities are conducted. It defines three contexts for conducting activities and tasks:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>problem context</strong> to help ensure that the engineering is driven by a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>solution context</strong> to drive the effort to provide the solution, supported by a set of activities to design and realize the solution.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>trustworthiness context</strong> is a decision-making context that provides an evidence-based demonstration – through reasoning – that the system of interest is deemed trustworthy (or not) based on a set of claims derived from security objectives.</p></li></ul><h3 id=nist-sp-800-160-vol-2>NIST SP 800-160 Vol 2</h3><p>Cyber resiliency for systems that include or depend on cyber resources is a part of operational resilience but needs specific guidance due to its distinctive characteristics. The publication provides guidance on how to apply cyber resiliency concepts, constructs, and engineering practices to systems security engineering and risk management. It is to be used by systems security engineering and other professionals, who are responsible for activities and tasks related to system life cycle and risk management processes within and external to the organisation.</p><p>While much of the cyber resiliency analysis in the publication uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&amp;CK™) framework, organisations are not constrained to use only the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework but can use other frameworks too.</p><p>Useful concepts from the publication are described below. Readers are advised to consult the publication for detailed information and guidance on cyber resiliency.</p><p><strong>Cyber-resilient systems</strong> are systems that have security measures or safeguards “built in” as a foundational part of the architecture and design and that display a high level of resiliency to withstand cyber-attacks, faults, and failures and continue to operate in a degraded or debilitated state to carry out the mission-essential functions of the organisation.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency engineering practices</strong> are the methods, processes, modelling, and analytical techniques used to identify and analyse proposed solutions. These practices are applied in system life cycle processes so that the resultant <strong>cyber resiliency solutions</strong> are aligned with the stakeholder requirements and protection needs.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency engineering framework</strong> provides constructs that include cyber resiliency goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, and design principles. While these constructs are applied at the system level in the publication, they can also be applied beyond the system level to mission and business function level, organisational level and sector level. The framework is based on Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework developed by the MITRE Corporation<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>,<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>.</p><p>Cyber resiliency goals and objectives provide a vocabulary for describing what properties and capabilities are needed. Cyber resiliency techniques, approaches, and design principles provide a vocabulary for discussing how a system can achieve its cyber resiliency goals and objectives.</p><p>Four cyber resiliency goals, namely Anticipate, Withstand, Recover and Adapt, eight cyber resiliency objectives and 14 cyber resiliency techniques are part of the cyber resiliency engineering framework.</p><p><strong>Cyber resiliency solutions</strong> are relevant only if they have some effect on risk. Hence their primary focus is to reduce the risk by reducing the three core factors</p><ul><li>the <strong>likelihood of occurrence</strong> of threat events,</li><li>the ability of threat events to cause harm, i.e., the <strong>likelihood of impact</strong>,</li><li>the extent of harm from threat events, i.e., the <strong>level of impact</strong>.</li></ul><p>The publication describes three models, namely the <strong>risk model, threat model</strong> and <strong>consequence (impact) model</strong> for cyber resiliency. It further identifies controls from NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 that directly support cyber resiliency. The principle applied for associating controls with cyber resiliency is that “cyber resiliency is about ensuring continued mission operations despite the fact that an adversary has established a foothold in the organisation’s systems and cyber infrastructure”. It also provides guidance on adversary-oriented analysis for achieving cyber resiliency, specifically the perspective of protecting systems against adversarial threats using MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ for Enterprise<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> and ATT&amp;CK™ for Industrial Control Systems (ICS)<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> frameworks.

Readers must consult the authoritative sources for the actual guidelines.</p><p>Open automation formats and protocols are essential tools that facilitate interoperability and integration among various systems, devices, and software applications. Designed to enable standardised communication, these formats and protocols provide a common language for systems in industries such as cyber security, telecommunications, and IT, allowing for seamless automation processes across diverse platforms. Some of these relevant for cyber security are referred in subsequent paras with purpose and usage.</p><h4 id=stix>STIX</h4><p>Overview: To share CTI, it is imperative that the underlying platform converts the data into a form that is ready for being sent through the network. To that end a process is required to convert the data-object (a combination of code and data) in a form so that the state of the object is saved in a transmittable format. This is known as Serialization . Once the data is received at the destination in a Serialized form, it is Deserialized before further processing. STIX stands for Structured Threat Information Expression. It is an open source, XML based &ldquo;language and serialization format used to exchange&rdquo; CTI. STIX is a standardized language for representing and sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) in a consistent, machine-readable format. Developed by MITRE and now managed by OASIS, STIX enables organisations to share detailed threat information, including attack patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and threat actor profiles. The structured nature of STIX allows cybersecurity tools to process threat data automatically, enhancing detection, analysis, and response capabilities across systems</p><p>Purpose: Leveraging STIX, organisations can collaborate effectively while exchanging CTI because of the consistency and machine readability that STIX provides. Consequently, security communities benefit as anticipation to attacks improve and agility in response mechanisms is enhanced. Further, its design is such that it augments capabilities, such as &ldquo;collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response&rdquo; .</p><p>Usage: STIX at its core architectural layer contains &ldquo;observables&rdquo; that it refers to as &ldquo;stateful properties or measurable events&rdquo;, pertaining to the &ldquo;operation of computers and networks&rdquo;. For example, it could be stopping a service, reboot of a system or establishing a connection. Storage of these &ldquo;observables&rdquo; is done in XML using &ldquo;CybOX language, another MITRE project&rdquo;. Further, as a part of the framework, these &ldquo;observables can be linked to indicators, incidents, TTPs, specific threat actors, adversary campaigns, specific targets, data markings, and courses of action&rdquo; - that it evolves into a &ldquo;complete threat intelligence management system&rdquo;.</p><h4 id=taxii>TAXII</h4><p>Overview: TAXII stands for Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information. It is an &ldquo;application protocol for exchanging CTI over HTTPS, defining &ldquo;a RESTful API (a set of services and message exchanges) and a set of requirements for TAXII Clients and Servers&rdquo; .
An API, or an Application Programming Interface plays the role of a mediator between the Client and the Web Service. The advantage here is that information sharing is done &ldquo;maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what&rdquo;. A RESTful (or REST - representational state transfer) API &ldquo;conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services&rdquo;. For an API to be a RESTful API, it needs to comply with certain criteria like &ldquo;Client-server architecture&rdquo;, with HTTP based requests, &ldquo;Stateless Client-Server communication&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cacheable data&rdquo; etc.</p><p>Purpose: It enables sharing CTI &ldquo;across product, service and organisational boundaries&rdquo; and acts as a &ldquo;transport vehicle for STIX structured threat information&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: The two primary services TAXII provides are: (a) Collection and (b) Channel. The TAXII server has a repository of CTI objects that it allows its Users to host, which can be accessed by consumers. Collection is an interface to this repository. A Channel can be viewed as a many to many interface - that allows a producer to push data to many consumers and a consumer to receive data from many producers.</p><h4 id=traffic-light-protocol-tlp>Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)</h4><h5 id=information-sharing>Information Sharing</h5><p>The critical success factors for cyber resilience and sustenance of a digital ecosystem are:
a) The speed and quality of detection of compromise and cyber-attacks within the entities.
b) The rapidity by which information and guidance is disseminated to all the actual and potential targets.
c) The speed and effectiveness of response within entities as well as across sectors and cross-sectors.</p><p>Conventional paper-based and email-based methods of sharing are not capable of achieving the required speed in information sharing amongst all the stakeholders and participants, since they are less amenable for automated processing. Traffic Light Protocol is a standardised mechanism for sharing information. TLP version 2.0 is the current version of TLP standardized by FIRST. The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration. Information sharing happens from an information source, towards one or more recipients. TLP is a set of four labels used to indicate the sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipients.</p><h5 id=tlp-definitions>TLP definitions</h5><p>Community: Under TLP, a community is a group who share common goals, practices, and informal trust relationships. A community can be as broad as all cybersecurity practitioners in a country (or in a sector or region).</p><p>Organisation: Under TLP, an organisation is a group who share a common affiliation by formal membership and are bound by common policies set by the organisation. An organisation can be as broad as all members of an information sharing organisation, but rarely broader.</p><p>Clients: Under TLP, clients are those people or entities that receive cybersecurity services from an organisation. Clients are by default included in TLP:AMBER so that the recipients may share information further downstream in order for clients to take action to protect themselves. For teams with national responsibility this definition includes stakeholders and constituents.</p><h5 id=tlp-labels>TLP Labels</h5><p>TLP:RED = For the eyes and ears of individual recipients only, no further disclosure. Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon without significant risk for the privacy, reputation, or operations of the organisations involved. Recipients may therefore not share TLP:RED information with anyone else. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting.</p><p>TLP:AMBER = Limited disclosure, recipients can only spread this on a need-to-know basis within their organisation and its clients. Note that TLP:AMBER+STRICT restricts sharing to the organisation only. Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organisations involved. Recipients may share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organisation and its clients, but only on a need-to-know basis to protect their organisation and its clients and prevent further harm. Note: if the source wants to restrict sharing to the organisation only, they must specify TLP:AMBER+STRICT.</p><p>TLP:GREEN = Limited disclosure, recipients can spread this within their community. Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful to increase awareness within their wider community. Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner organisations within their community, but not via publicly accessible channels. TLP:GREEN information may not be shared outside of the community. Note: when “community” is not defined, assume the cybersecurity/defence community.</p><p>TLP:CLEAR = Recipients can spread this to the world, there is no limit on disclosure. Sources may use TLP:CLEAR when information carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:CLEAR information may be shared without restriction.</p><h4 id=oscal>OSCAL</h4><p>Overview: In the context of NIST, an ATO or an Authorization (to operate) is defined as &ldquo;The official management decision given by a senior organisational official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organisational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organisational assets, individuals, other organisations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls&rdquo; . In essence there has to be a formal declaration by a designated authority that authorises operation of an IT product, which includes all the caveats around Risk. Apart from the inherent complexity in handling cyber threats, addressing ATO requirements coupled with the extensive manual processes in handling Risk Management increases the challenges of an Entity&rsquo;s Information Security Team. The four key challenges in this regard stated by NIST are: - (a) Complexity of Information Technology (b) Omnipresent Vulnerabilities (c) Burdensome nature of Regulatory Frameworks (d) Esoteric nature of Risk Management (e) Accelerated rate of obsolescence of Documentation .</p><p>Purpose: The open source, Open Security Controls Assessment Language - or OSCAL, was developed by NIST in collaboration with industry to address the concerns around this space. To overcome the challenges around usage of word processing and spread sheet utilities to handle RMF requirements, improved automation was an imperative. There was a need, therefore, to evolve &ldquo;a shared language for authorization systems to communicate&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: OSCAL uses XML, JSON, and YAML formats, providing &ldquo;machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results&rdquo;. The advantages of OSCAL formats as stated by NIST are: - &ldquo;Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs, Establish and share machine-readable control baselines, Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in your systems, Automate the monitoring and assessment of your system control implementation effectiveness&rdquo; .</p><h4 id=openscap>OpenSCAP</h4><p>Overview: In any enterprise, the IT systems deployed need to be constantly monitored for vulnerabilities so that remediation measures in terms of configuration changes, patch updates and / or application of upgrades are done in a timely manner. This minimizes risk exposure of the assets within, and the enterprise is better guarded against security threats. The Security Content Automation Protocol - SCAP, is a collection of &ldquo;number of open standards that are widely used to enumerate software flaws and configuration issues related to security&rdquo;. In order to associate a metric or measure the possible impact due to the vulnerabilities within the system, applications written for security monitoring leverage these standards. Thus the &ldquo;SCAP suite of specifications standardize the nomenclature and formats&rdquo;, that is leveraged by these vulnerability management tools.</p><p>Purpose: OpenSCAP is an auditing tool that utilizes security check-list content in a defined format called the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF). Combing with other specifications it creates a SCAP-expressed checklist that can be processed by SCAP-validated products.</p><p>Audience: IT / IT Security Administrators, Auditors</p><p>Usage: The OpenSCAP stack consists of different products that can help with &ldquo;assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines&rdquo;, maintaining &ldquo;flexibility and interoperability&rdquo; and &ldquo;reducing the costs of performing security audits&rdquo; . A few of the Tools in the stack include: - (a) OpenSCAP Base: A Command line tool for performing configuration & vulnerability scanning (b) OpenSCAP Daemon: Evaluating Infrastructure’s compliance to SCAP Policy (c) SCAP Workbench: Helps create a custom security profile and facilitates remote scanning.</p><h4 id=open-command--control-openc2>Open Command & Control (OpenC2)</h4><p>Overview: Attackers are in a position to conduct and coordinate various stages of an attack with remarkable sophistication and speed. If Defenders are to sustain their operations, they need to respond with equal alacrity; plan and conduct defense operations in a timeframe that matches the adversary so as to ensure that the latter fails to attain their objectives. But the penetrability of an attack surface is determined by a range of factors that include “complexity, functionality, connectivity” etc. Further, most enterprises do not have an integrated cyber defense implementation; the systems operate in siloes and generally have static configurations. This results in very inefficient cybersecurity operations. Such an environment, by default creates a lag in incident-response-remediation, which gives an adversary &ldquo;asymmetric time advantage&rdquo;, to ensure the success of their attack. In a large enterprise there would be number of heterogenous platforms, technologies, devices, and systems. Effective incident response, getting into the root cause, assessing remediation measures, and mitigating them etc. become complex. In such a context, few challenges of integrating the various components of cyber defense include: - (a) Prohibitive costs (b) Tailored Communication Interfaces&rdquo; (c) Extent of tight-coupling and cohesiveness of the chosen products for integration (d) Need for a middleware etc. As a consequence, scaling of such a solution would depend on ability to get suitable interfaces written or easily available APIs for the different products in use. Paradoxically though, while OEM diversity of solutions do provide an additional layer of security - as attack on one system does not guarantee attack on another, achieving cyber defense integration becomes complex and prohibitive in terms of costs. From an attack perspective, when an attacker penetrates a system and installs a malware which is leveraged to send remote commands from a C2 (Command & Control) Server to infected devices, it is termed a C2 attack. In other words, &ldquo;command and control infrastructure&rdquo; is used by attackers to issue &ldquo;command and control instructions&rdquo; to their victims. From a cyber-defense viewpoint, an assessment of the C2 approach and methods that an attacker uses could be leveraged to identify and associate attackers and attacks, and disrupt malicious activity that are ongoing.</p><p>Purpose: The limitations in integrating cyber defense solutions, stated earlier was the trigger for development of Open Command and Control (OpenC2) . It &ldquo;is a suite of specifications that enable command and control of cyber defense systems and components&rdquo; - facilitating &ldquo;machine to machine communication&rdquo;, through a &ldquo;common language&rdquo;. More important, it does it at very high speeds and in such a way &ldquo;that is agnostic of the overall underlying technologies utilized&rdquo;. But for this standard, every new device would need manual configuration or individual commands sent in real time, which apart from increasing the lag in incident response times, would also have human intervention, making it error prone.</p><h4 id=software-bill-of-materials-sbom>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</h4><p>Overview: The entire source code of a software is referred to as its codebase. It is a common practice for developers to integrate with their code, third party components that are licensed and either commercially available or are open source. A SBOM or software Bill of Materials is an inventory of all the &ldquo;open source and third-party components&rdquo; that are present, providing details of their versions and status of the patches within the codebase of a software application / product. Information security teams can use this information to assess security & license related risks. Akin to the Manufacturing industry&rsquo;s Bill of Material (from where SBOM has been derived) where the codification schemes of the parts provided by OEM and Suppliers are distinct, based on which a successful trace to the correct supplier happens when a part goes defective; here too a trail to the accurate third party is established by virtue of the SBOM. There are four stages of an SBOM life cycle. They are: (a) Produce SBOM - Collating the information required for an SBOM at each stage of the software lifecycle from existing tools and solutions. Such solutions normally include: - &ldquo;intellectual property review&rdquo;, &ldquo;license management workflow tools&rdquo;, &ldquo;version control systems&rdquo; etc. (b) Deliver - In the case of opensource tools, the SBOM information can be held as metadata, while for compiled versions the SBOM and the software product are bundled together. (c) Update - If the software is updated in any manner, then any changes in SBOM too needs to be recorded. (d) Consume - In order to utilise SBOM, the SBOM data should be in a machine readable format. However, the decision on choosing the appropriate format that should be adopted for SBOM needs to be taken. The three standard and common formats in use are CycloneDX, SWID and SPDX.</p><h5 id=cyclonedx>CycloneDX</h5><p>Purpose: &ldquo;OWASP CycloneDX is a lightweight&rdquo; SBOM specification &ldquo;designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis&rdquo;, created in 2017 . The intent was to create a &ldquo;fully automatable, security-focused SBOM standard&rdquo;. Existing specifications like Package URL, CPE, SWID etc., have been incorporated into CycloneDX. Each such SBOM can have (a) Bill of Material Metadata (supplier, manufacturer, firmware etc. that it describes), (b) Components - detailed inventory of the software components, which includes type, identity, license etc. (c) Services - description of external APIs, that the utility may invoke (d) Dependencies - interrelationship between components (e) Compositions - that describes the &lsquo;completeness&rsquo; of the SBOM. (f) Extensions - For building rapid prototyping of enhancements.</p><p>Usage: Software Inventory description, Analysis, Analysis of vulnerabilities and their mitigation, Supply Chain (Software) risk assessments, Compliance of License requirements, Traceability of updates and modifications, Integrity checks of signed components etc.</p><h5 id=swid>SWID</h5><p>Purpose: To enhance transparency in monitoring Software installed within the enterprise, Software Identification (SWID) tags were conceptualised and defined originally by ISO (2012) and later updated as ISO/IEC standard (2015). Description of a specific software release is held in the SWID Tag files. The standard further &ldquo;defines a lifecycle where a SWID Tag is added to an endpoint as part of the software product’s installation process and deleted by the product’s uninstall process&rdquo;. In order to capture the lifecycle of a software component, the SWID specification defines following types of Tags: (a) Primary Tag (b) Patch Tag (c) Corpus Tag and (d) Supplemental Tag. SWID Tag that identifies and describes: - (a) a software product installed on a computing device is called a Patch Tag (b) a patch that was installed for making a change of the software installed on the device is referred to as a Patch Tag (c) the pre-installation state of a software product is called a Corpus tag and finally a SWID Tag that permits &ldquo;additional information to be associated with any referenced SWID tag&rdquo; is referred to as a Supplemental tag.</p><p>Usage: Few use cases are: (a) It can be used as Software Bill of Material for the software products and applications installed (b) Inventory of installed software can be regularly monitored (c) Software vulnerability identification at end points can be carried out (d) Ensures proper patch management (e) Detects unauthorized or corrupt software prior to their installation and prevents their installation.</p><h5 id=spdx>SPDX</h5><p>Purpose: SPDX or Software Package Data Exchange , is an ISO /IEC standard. It is used for communicating software bill of material information that includes components, licenses, copyright and security information. It is an evolving &ldquo;set of data exchange standards&rdquo; that would assist enterprises with their software supply chain ecosystem by allowing each of them &ldquo;to share human-readable and machine-processable software metadata&rdquo; with one another. Like in the case of SWID, stated earlier, work here too began because of limitations that existed in the earlier days of sharing opensource components, resulting in duplication of efforts. Also, collaboration was difficult then. SPDX project created &ldquo;a common metadata exchange format&rdquo; which allowed details about software packages and associated content to be collected, shared and made effective automation of the related tasks, feasible. The file formats used here include JSON, XML and YAML. A valid SPDX document has a defined structure with defined sections as stated in the SPDX specification. The section that is mandatory is the &ldquo;Creation Information&rsquo; (version numbers, license of data etc.) - primarily provided for forward and backward compatibility of the tools. The others include &ldquo;Package Information&rdquo;, &ldquo;File Information&rdquo;, &ldquo;Snippet Information&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Licensing Information.</p><p>Usage: Description of software components and their interrelationships; Tracking licensing, copyright information related to IP; Tracking executables to the source files etc.</p><h4 id=openioc>OpenIOC</h4><p>Overview: Like in the case of collating evidence, analyzing them and then weaving it together to reconstruct a crime scene, a cybersecurity analyst too as a part of her function tries to gather data around different events related to new and emerging threats. The nature of this data could be &ldquo;metadata elements or much more complex malicious code and content samples that require advanced reverse engineering&rdquo;. The final output of this action is what is generally referred to as IOC or Indicators of compromise. In other words, IOC can be defined as &ldquo;a forensic artifact or remnant of an intrusion that can be identified on a host or network&rdquo;.</p><p>Purpose: OpenIOC is an XML based open framework used for sharing CTI.</p><p>Usage: The format used is machine-readable and assists sharing threats related to the latest IOCs, with other enterprises, helping achieve real-time protection. OpenIoc provides a pre-defined set of indicators as a part of the framework. The extensible nature of the base schema allows add on indicators from different sources. The IOC use cases include: (a) Finding Malware - Used to find known malware (b) Methodology - These IOCs help find suspicious utilities that are unknown. For instance, writing an IOC for a specific condition of an unsigned dll that was loaded from a folder that did not have &ldquo;windows32system&rdquo; in its path (c) Bulk - Used for exact matches (d) Investigative - Tracking information like, metadata related to &ldquo;installation of backdoors&rdquo;, &ldquo;execution of tools&rdquo; etc. in an IOC and using that to prioritise the systems that would be taken up to be analysed.</p><h4 id=openedr>OpenEDR</h4><p>Overview: Endpoint detection and response or EDR is a technology that focuses on endpoints and network related events. The agent on the host system helps log the information generated and stores it in a database. This repository is what is leveraged for event monitoring and generating reports. Different EDR solutions package their functions and features differently. Some focus more at the agent level, some have different way of handling schedules for collection and analysis, some others carry out integration tasks with a difference. Functions of EDR are: (a) Traffic and data monitoring from endpoints and checking for anomalies hinting a breach. (b) Automated responses - Removal of malicious files and alerts to information security teams. (c) Search for threats and their signatures through analytics. The core functions of all tools in this space are the same - &ldquo;continuous monitoring and analysis&rdquo; for being proactive to respond to threats.</p><p>Purpose: OpenEDR is an EDR tool that is both free and its source code available in public domain. It consists of the following components: - (a) Core Library (b) Service (c) Process Monitoring (d) System Monitor (e) File-System Mini-Filter (f) Network Monitor (g) Low-Level Registry Monitoring Component (h) Self-Protection Provider (i) Low-Level Process Monitoring Component.</p><p>Usage: One of OpenEDR’s strengths is to enable a user to affect an accurate RCA. Without a clear understanding of root cause, mitigation measures would prove inadequate. The output from the tool provides &ldquo;actionable knowledge&rdquo; which helps speed up response. Further its, “Integrated Security Architecture” helps deliver a “Full Attack Vector Visibility including MITRE Framework”.</p><h4 id=opendxl>OpenDXL</h4><p>Overview: Proliferation of different technologies from various IT Infra and Security Vendors over time, with different upgrade paths, coupled with several home-grown initiatives – all, connected through an underlying network, has made IT Security Management a complex task. Achieving seamless integration between security products from different Vendors has been a constant challenge. API driven integration comes with major maintenance issues. Integration of products from different Vendors also has administrative overheads that includes external dependencies. For instance, getting a buy in from each of the Vendors, their prioritization, commercial interests etc. An application&rsquo;s limitations for easily accessing emerging CTI data becomes an impediment for each, to apply the insights on emerging threats, making the environment vulnerability prone. As a result, the cyber resilience posture is affected adversely. The mechanism through which security solutions are connected and integration of disparate security systems are achieved is termed as Orchestration. Since substantial volume of output logs are created by security tools currently, SOCs tend to miss intrusions. Security Orchestration addresses this concern.</p><p>Purpose: Open Data Exchange Layer or OpenDXL has been developed with the intent of enabling &ldquo;security devices to share intelligence and orchestrate security operations in real time&rdquo;. It facilitates the developer community to establish handshakes between security products and minimize lead times of threat defense, by improving &ldquo;context of analysis&rdquo;, shortening &ldquo;workflows of the threat defense lifecycle&rdquo; etc. The key goals of OpenDXL can be summarized as follows: (a) Enhance flexibility (b) Make integration easier (c) Accelerate development by providing appropriate toolsets (d) Increase Sec Ops ability in creating &ldquo;cross-product, cross-vendor security automation&rdquo; and (e) Ensure that API changes by Vendors do not adversely impact integration.</p><p>Usage: Use Cases include: &ldquo;Deception threat events, File and application reputation changes, Mobile devices and assets discovered, Network and user behavior changes, High-fidelity alerts, Vulnerability and indicator of compromise (IoC) data”.</p><h4 id=infrastructure-as-code-iac>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h4><p>Overview: Like all disciplines in IT, managing IT Infrastructure has gone through its own evolution process. In the past it was customary for manually addressing all aspects of configuration, whether it was hardware or software over which the applications were required to run on. Costs, scalability, availability were all challenges that the organisations had to surmount. Monitoring performance of IT Infra or pinpointing the problem during troubleshooting continued to be an Achilles heel for the IT Infra team. Due to the human intensive nature of deploying configurations, inconsistencies crept in. Therefore, there was a need to explore the possibility of automating configuration management and thereby managing and provisioning IT Infrastructure through code. In that context, two file formats are defined here: (a) JSON: JSON or JavaScript Object Notation originated as a page scripting language in the Netscape Navigator era, for its web browser. It is a format with a defined set of rules that is &ldquo;text-based, human-readable&rdquo;, leveraged for data exchange between &ldquo;web clients and web servers&rdquo;, sometimes used as an alternative to XML. (b) YAML: YAML or yet another markup language (referred to also as, ain&rsquo;t another markup language) - A human readable, easily comprehensible language, used for data and not documents is a &ldquo;data serialization language&rdquo; which is regularly leveraged while writing configuration files.</p><p>Purpose: Infrastructure as Code or IaC, is defined as &ldquo;The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools&rdquo;. In effect it leverages a DevOps approach to deploy IT infrastructure - networks, VMs etc. Akin to a codebase generating identical binary every time, here too the same environment is generated during every deployment. There are two approaches to IaC: (a) Declarative - Where the required state of the system is defined. An environment would need a tailored definition with regards its components and configuration. The definition file describes that. Depending on the kind file formats that the Platform supports - be they JSON, YAML or XML, syntax for describing IaC can be decided. (b) Imperative - &ldquo;defines the specific commands needed to achieve the desired configuration&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: Some of the advantages of using IaC are: (a) Reduce Cost (b) Accelerate deployment (c) Less Errors (d) Enhance consistency (e) &ldquo;Eliminate configuration drift&rdquo;. More insights can be gleaned from studying Server automation and config management tools like Chef, Puppet, Saltstack etc.</p><h4 id=policy-as-code>Policy-as-Code</h4><p>Overview: In a growing tech landscape, it is inevitable not to think of automation when rolling out policies. As proliferation of IT driven solutions take place, protecting the systems from threats is an imperative. For which, rules and procedures are defined as a part of security policy formulation - be it, access control, authorization, network security etc. In essence, a policy is a rule that stipulates the criteria for code deployment against the backdrop of the security control implemented or a set of steps to be executed automatically when there is a particular security event.</p><p>Purpose: Policy-as-code is the use of a high-level declarative language to automate managing rules and policies centrally. Leveraging this approach, users write the policies using Python, YAML or Rego - a high-level declarative language &ldquo;built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures&rdquo;, depending on the kind of policy-as-code tool that is being used. While IaC benefits the IT operations team where automated provisioning of Infrastructure is involved, policy-as-code focuses on security operations and compliance management. To leverage policy-as-code the user may choose to use a tool like Open Policy Agent or OPA, purpose of which is to provide a common framework while applying policy-as-code to any domain. OPA is a &ldquo;general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack&rdquo;. It allows authoring of policies through Rego. OPA can be leveraged to outsource policy decisions from the relevant service. Eg: Boolean decisions of whether an API call should be allowed, Quota left for a user, the updates to be applied for a particular resource etc.</p><p>Usage: The advantages of using policy-as-code are: (a) Enhanced efficiency of enforcement and sharing of policies vis-a-vis the manual route (b) Accelerated operations because of automated policy enforcement (c) Swifter reviewing of policies as there is no requirement for engineers to discuss, they need to only examine the code (d) Improved collaboration within and across teams (e) Accuracy (f) Well defined version controlling of the policies and ability to roll back to the previous version (g) Helps reduce critical errors in production environments.</p><h4 id=omg-requirements-interchange-format-reqif>OMG Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF)</h4><p>Overview: Requirements management has been in vogue across different industries for a while. The collaboration requirements in the manufacturing industry – car manufacturing, for instance, uses dedicated authoring tools for their requirement management. Since collaboration requirements are intense, requirements management cross organisational boundaries - and different entities using different authoring tools find it a challenge to work on the same requirements repository. There was a compelling case, therefore, for a &ldquo;generic, non-proprietary format&rdquo; for information exchange. Hence, The Requirements Interchange Format or ReqIF was created for enterprises to exchange requirements data, by transferring XML documents that comply to the ReqIF format.</p><p>Purpose: Any product development during the initial stages has a requirement gathering phase. This is where ReqIF finds a key use, as multiple entities could be involved. ReqIF facilitates seamless sharing of requirements between agencies, even if each uses a different tool. It is far more efficient than formats like Word, Excel or PDF as it “allows for a loss-free exchange”.</p><p>Usage: Few of the advantages of using this format are: Improved collaboration between entities; Obviates the need to use the same authoring tools, Agencies interacting with multiple entities (eg: Suppliers) do not need stack up authoring tools that their respective Customers use.</p><h4 id=oasis-cacao-for-cybersecurity>OASIS CACAO for Cybersecurity</h4><p>Overview: It is apparent that in order to defend against cybersecurity threats, a structured set of rules need to be defined. A cybersecurity playbook is generally considered to be a comprehensive manual that spells out actions to be taken when there is theft or loss of data. To that end, enterprises need to &ldquo;identify, create, and document the prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps&rdquo;, currently in most cases done manually. These steps considered together, constitute a course of action playbook. Like in other areas of the cybersecurity domain, here too lack of a standard mechanism to &ldquo;document and share these playbooks across organisational boundaries&rdquo; compounded with inadequate automation, proves to be a challenge.</p><p>Purpose: OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (or CACAO) for Cyber Security Technical Committee (TC), tackles this challenge by &ldquo;defining a sequence of cyber defense actions that can be executed for each type of playbook&rdquo;.</p><p>Usage: This will help entities to: (a) “create course of action playbooks in a structured machine-readable format” (b) “digitally sign course of action playbooks” (c) “securely share course of action playbooks across organisational boundaries and technological solutions” and (d) “document processing instructions for course of action playbooks in a machine-readable format”.</p><hr><footer class=footline><i class='fa-fw fas fa-calendar'></i> 25 Sep 2025</footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=people-related-frameworks>People related Frameworks</h1><p>This section summarises content from QCI and other frameworks that are related to individual and organisational competencies.

The ecosystems encompass a large number and variety of technologies, products, platforms, systems, networks, applications, databases and services, which may be deployed on-premises, on cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) or in hybrid mode.</p><p>Enterprises usually have multiple teams of IT, OT, IIoT, information security and cybersecurity professionals and managers, who are responsible to carry out the organisations’ functions, activities and tasks related to the digital ecosystem of the organisation. CSEs and other organisations would derive significant benefits by establishing a strategic program and structured approach to ensure that their workforce and teams managing the digital ecosystem have the requisite cybersecurity competence (knowledge, skills and levels of expertise) to be effective in handling the entire gamut of work and responsibilities of IT, OT, IIoT, information security and cybersecurity.</p><h3 id=workforce-composition>Workforce Composition</h3><p>Given the size and complexity of digital ecosystem, it may be impractical for most CSEs and other organisations to depend solely upon their internal workforce to acquire, implement, engineer, operate, manage and sustain the ecosystem. In practice, the organisations have a <strong>composite workforce</strong> that has a mix of own employees, hired manpower, specialist (OEM, ISV, SI, SaaS) teams and resources of managed services providers (MSPs), who work together to carry out the functions, activities and tasks related to the digital ecosystem.</p><h4 id=workforce-hierarchy>Workforce Hierarchy</h4><p>At an organisational level the digital ecosystem workforce can be divided into multiple levels of hierarchy, as given below.

Technical work and its deliverables could be assigned to external teams from OEMs, SIs, MSPs and other service providers, as long as the overall supervision and oversight is handled by designated senior and middle level managers of the organisation. The middle and lower management levels, and individual contributors, are accountable and responsible for day-to-day operational activities and tasks.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
Note</summary><div class=box-content><p>The concept of &ldquo;virtual managers&rdquo; or &ldquo;external advisors with C-level access&rdquo; is gaining acceptance amongst many organisations, who need such services in a more flexible, scalable and cost-effective manner. The virtual manager, for example, a virtual chief information security officer (vCISO) performs most of the core functions as a traditional, full-time manager.

An illustrative list of knowledge and skill specialisation areas for the composite workforce is given below. <a href=https://www.nciipc.gov.in/documents/CAF/Book_Personnel-Certification-Scheme_vF_v.P_31.03.2024.pdf rel=external target=_blank>Source: NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for Cybersecurity Professionals</a>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>.</th><th>Knowledge and Skills Specialisation Areas</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><em>Knowledge Area</em></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Network Infrastructure & Network Security</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Systems (HW, VM, Firmware, OS) Security</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Software and Platform Operations Security</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Secure Systems Engineering</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Secure Software Design & Development</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Enterprise Supply Chain</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Enterprise IT and Information Security</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Enterprise Cyber Defence and Security Operations</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Data Analytics</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Cyber Forensics</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Cyber Security Training & Awareness</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>ICS Cyber Security</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><em>Skills</em></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Programming & Scripting</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Managing and Securing Systems, Networks, Applications</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Managing and Securing Information, Data And Identities</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Custom Software Development and Management</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Cyber Defence and Security Operations</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Others (OEM/ ISV Technologies and Products)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each knowledge and skill area also has an expertise level (basic, intermediate, expert) associated with it. The expertise levels should generally be mapped to the workforce hierarchy, keeping in view the functions executed by a particular hierarchy of the workforce, the size of organisation and the complexity of their digital ecosystem. For example, junior levels are expected to acquire at least the basic level of expertise, while middle and senior levels are expected to acquire intermediate or expert level of expertise. Professionals working with the OEMs, ISVs, SIs, MSPs and other service providers are expected to have intermediate or expert level of expertise in their respective areas of specialisation.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

It manifests itself in the form of a digital ecosystem across the world.</li></ul><p>Note 1: The national cyberspace is a subset of the global cyberspace, used by the nation’s organisations and people for their business and personal functions. The national cyberspace is not defined by who owns it but by who uses it.</p><p>Note 2: An Indian organisation’s cyberspace is a subset within the national cyberspace, used by the organisation for its business functions. The organisation acquires the digital infrastructure and uses it to deploy and run applications that enable and support the organisation’s business/ operations. The organisation federates its digital infrastructure with other organisations within the national and global cyberspace.</p><p>Note 3: An organisation’s own cyberspace and the national cyberspace can be demarcated within the global cyberspace by means of domains, zones and segments.</p><h6 id=critical-information-infrastructure-itaa-2008>Critical Information Infrastructure (ITAA-2008)</h6><ul><li>the computer resource, the incapacitation or destruction of which, shall have debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health or safety.</li></ul><h6 id=critical-sectors-gsr-19e-16-jan-2014>Critical sectors (G.S.R. 19(E), 16 Jan 2014)</h6><ul><li>sectors, which are critical to the nation and whose incapacitation or destruction will have a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health, or safety.</li></ul><h6 id=information-technology-it-nist>Information Technology (IT) (NIST)</h6><ul><li>any services, equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that are used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information.</li></ul><h6 id=information-and-communications-technology-ict-nist>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) (NIST)</h6><ul><li>all categories of ubiquitous technology used for the gathering, storing, transmitting, retrieving, or processing of information (e.g., microelectronics, printed circuit boards, computing systems, software, signal processors, mobile telephony, satellite communications, and networks).</li></ul><h6 id=operations-technology-ot-nist>Operations Technology (OT) (NIST)</h6><ul><li>a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment or manage devices that interact with the physical environment. These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events.</li></ul><p>Note 1: Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.</p><p>Note 2: Alternative terms for OT are Industrial Control Systems (ICS) <em>(used by NIST)</em> and Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) <em>(used by IEC)</em>.</p><h6 id=internet-of-things-iot-nist>Internet of Things (IoT) (NIST)</h6><ul><li>user or industrial devices that are connected to the internet. IoT devices include sensors, controllers, and household appliances.</li></ul><h6 id=industrial-internet-of-things-iiot-nist>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) (NIST)</h6><ul><li>sensors, instruments, machines, and other devices that are networked together and use Internet connectivity to enhance industrial and manufacturing business processes and applications.</li></ul><p>Note 1: An IoT device has at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world and at least one wired or wireless network interface (e.g., ethernet, wi-fi, bluetooth, Long-Term Evolution (LTE), Zigbee, Ultra-Wideband (UWB)) for interfacing with the digital world (NIST IR 8259).</p><p>Note 2: An IoT product contains at least one IoT device and three specific kinds of IoT product components (NIST IR 8425):</p><ul><li><p>Specialty networking/ gateway hardware.</p></li><li><p>Companion application software.</p></li><li><p>Backends to which data is transferred for backup, storage and analysis.</p></li></ul><p>Note 3: An IoT system is composed of networked IoT components and interacts with a physical entity of interest through one or more sensors and/or actuators that are within the IoT components. IoT systems differ from conventional IT systems in their ability to directly interact with the physical world (NIST IR 8316).</p><h6 id=glossary_system>System (ISO 15288:2015)</h6><ul><li>combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes.</li></ul><p>Note 1: A system is sometimes considered as a product or as the services it provides.</p><p>Note 2: In practice, the interpretation of its meaning is frequently clarified by the use of an associative
noun, e.g. aircraft system. Alternatively, the word “system” is substituted simply by a context-dependent
synonym, e.g. aircraft, though this potentially obscures a system principles perspective.</p><p>Note 3: A complete system includes all of the associated equipment, facilities, material, computer
programs, firmware, technical documentation, services and personnel required for operations and support to the degree necessary for self-sufficient use in its intended environment.</p><p>Note 4: Stakeholders, while expressing their perspectives, are encouraged to clarify the context of the term &lsquo;System&rsquo;. For example, in governance and business level interactions, &lsquo;System&rsquo; will typically represent the business function or process that is provided (Note 1 above). In technology level interactions, &lsquo;System&rsquo; will typically represent the technology and support elements (Note 3 above).</p><h6 id=glossary_system_of_interest>System-of-interest (ISO 15288:2015)</h6><ul><li>system whose life cycle is under consideration.</li></ul><h6 id=glossary_system_of_systems>System-of-systems (SoS) (ISO 15288:2015)</h6><ul><li>set of systems that integrate or interoperate to provide a unique capability that none of the constituent systems can accomplish on its own.</li></ul><p>Note 1: Each constituent system is a useful system by itself, having its own management, goals, and
resources, but coordinates within the SoS to provide the unique capability of the SoS.</p><h6 id=infosec_nist>Information security (IS) (NIST)</h6><ul><li>the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</li></ul><h6 id=infosec_iso_270000_2018>Information security (IS) (ISO 27000:2018)</h6><ul><li>preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.</li></ul><p>Note: In addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.</p><h6 id=cybersec_itaa_2008>Cyber security (CS) (ITAA-2008)</h6><ul><li>protecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</li></ul><p>Note 1: The definition is explicitly used for information technology (IT) elements and also for elements of operations technology (OT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).</p><p>Note 2: The terms Information Security (IS) and Cyber Security (CS) are often used interchangeably, since there are only some minor distinctions between the two terms. Notes 3 to 6 below provide guidance for specific situations in which one term is more appropriate than the other.</p><p>Note 3: In general, the information security is used in the context of securing information that is held and managed in both digital and non-digital (paper-based) forms. Cybersecurity is used in the context of securing the cyber-ecosystem (IT, OT, and IIoT) from cyber-attacks.</p><p>Note 4: Data and information content encompasses i) content created, used and managed using office productivity tools, ii) content stored in databases and other electronic repositories, which may be located on-premises or on cloud, iii) content searched, accessed and shared using web, email and other technologies, iv) machine to machine exchange of content through information exchange standards and protocols (EDI, API, STIX/TAXII), and OT-specific communication protocols (Modbus, DNP3/ IEEE 1815-2012, IEC-60870, IEC 61850, IEC 61131, IEC 62351) and, v) archival content stored in online and offline backups.</p><p>Note 5: Data and information related activities encompass i) content creation, updation and deletion (CRUD activities), ii) data processing, iii) view, copy, scan, search and print, iv) content integrity and confidentiality protection using digital signatures and encryption, v) masking or redaction of sensitive content and reclassification of the masked/ redacted content, vi) content exchange and distribution through electronic media and communication channels, vii) short-term and long-term storage of content and, viii) secure disposal of content from all the electronic stores, as per the organisation policies.</p><p>Note 6: Most OT systems are process control systems. Typically, the input and output OT data of such systems have a short period of utility. The most important concerns of such systems are the availability of the systems themselves, safety of the physical environment around the systems or influenced by them. The confidentiality of data exchanged through OT protocols, as well as intermittent data loss are minor concerns. As regards data integrity, the concern is more about the integrity of the process control systems that generate, consume and process the data using OT protocols. In summary, focus of OT security is more about protecting critical processes (Safety, Availability, Integrity) and less about data loss (Confidentiality).</p><h6 id=cyber-defence>Cyber defence</h6><ul><li>a set of defensive activities carried out across the organisation’s digital infrastructure by different teams of the organisation, by means of well-established practices and processes, with or without automation.</li></ul><p>Note 1: The objective of cyber defence is to prevent the organisation’s digital infrastructure from being harmed and to ensure its availability for use by all authorised users.</p><p>Note 2: Cyber defence is similar to physical defence but in the cyberspace. Just as in physical defence, securing the digital infrastructure of the nation and/ or organisations requires both proactive actions like anticipating, continually observing and plugging breaches, and reactive measures like responding to and mitigating cyberattacks when they occur.</p><h6 id=resilience_nist>Resilience (NIST)</h6><ul><li>the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruption. Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents.</li></ul><h6 id=cyberresilience_nist>Cyber resilience (NIST)</h6><ul><li><p>the ability of an information system to operate under adverse conditions or stress, even if in a degraded or debilitated state, while maintaining essential operational capabilities, and to recover to an effective operational posture in a time frame consistent with mission needs.</p></li><li><p>the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.</p></li></ul><p>Note: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting the digital infrastructure from unauthorised access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. Cyber resilience is an organisation’s capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber threats and disruptions. Both functions require a combination of technologies, practices and processes, policies and controls, peope and governance for delivering the required outcomes.</p><h6 id=domain_iso_iec_ieee>Domain (ISO/IEC/IEEE)</h6><ul><li><p>distinct scope, within which common characteristics are exhibited, common rules observed, and over which a distribution transparency is preserved.</p></li><li><p>area of knowledge or activity characterized by a set of concepts and terminology understood by practitioners in that area.</p></li></ul><h6 id=domain_nist>Domain (NIST)</h6><ul><li>a set of elements, data, resources, and functions that share a commonality in combinations of (1) roles supported, (2) rules governing their use, and (3) protection needs.</li></ul><p>Note 1: Domain Coverage/ Scope - A domain’s coverage/ scope lists the elements, data, resources, processes and practices grouped under the domain, to reflect one or any combination of the following: i) capability, functional, or service distinctions; ii) data flow and control flow associated with capability, functional, or service distinctions; iii) data and information sensitivity; iv) data and information security; or v) administrative, management, operational, or jurisdictional authority.</p><p>Note 2: Domain Principle/ Objective - A domain&rsquo;s principle/ objective describes at a high level what an organisation is required to do/ achieve with regard to the requirements for the domain, using the triad of processes, people and technology.</p><p>Note 3: &ldquo;Domain&rdquo; is a widely used term by different practitioners to describe their working environments. For example, management teams use the term to describe distinct functional areas and job responsibilities. Systems and software engineering teams classify their work into different technical domains. HR and training teams define knowledge and skill domains to refer to different sets of concepts, topics and modules about which the professionals are expected to possess or develop the required competency. Security teams define security domains to categorise the security characteristics, policies and authorities. Cybersecurity capability maturity modelling research teams use distinct domains to classify, gather evidence and measure the capability and maturity of organisations.</p><h6 id=glossary_policy>Policy (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>intentions and direction of an organisation as formally expressed by its governing body or executive managers acting with appropriate authority.</li></ul><p>Note 1: A &ldquo;policy&rdquo; is a high-level statement of intent or direction that provides guidance to individuals and organisations on how they should act in specific circumstances. A policy is a formal declaration of an organisation&rsquo;s objectives, values, and principles, and it provides the basis for decision-making and the development of related processes, procedures, and controls.</p><p>Note 2: Policies are an important component of a management system, as they provide the overall direction and guidance for the management system and help to ensure that the management system is aligned with the organisation&rsquo;s objectives and values. Policies should be clear, concise, and aligned with the overall strategic objectives of the organisation, to enable the management system to deliver its intended outcomes.</p><p>Note 3: A policy typically defines a scope (business processes, departments and locations that will be covered by the policy), the external and internal environment of the organisation (to identify the interfaces and dependencies), and the business, IT, and information security objectives of the policy (what it seeks to achieve).</p><h6 id=glossary_practice>Practice</h6><ul><li>a set of activities that are continuously carried out over time, in pursuit of an organisation&rsquo;s strategic interests and goals.</li></ul><p>Note 1: A &ldquo;practice&rdquo; typically comprises of persons/ teams owning the practice, along with activities, governance, tools, and technology platforms to implement and operate the practice. The <strong>intelligence of the practice</strong>—how it gets something accomplished—is embedded in the complex, analytical and decision-making expertise of the practice owners (individuals/ teams). The <strong>key outcomes of a practice</strong> are continuous refinement, optimisation of effort and leveraging of the organisation&rsquo;s expertise. The adoption of best practices can help organisations to improve their performance, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve their goals more effectively.</p><h6 id=glossary_process>Process</h6><ul><li><p>set of interrelated or interacting activities that use inputs to deliver an intended result. (ISO 9000:2015)</p></li><li><p>a set of repeatable activities and tasks, usually designed as a set of well-defined steps with well-defined beginnings and ends, to get something done.</p></li></ul><p>Note 1: A “process” typically comprises of people, activities and tasks, governance, tools, and technology platforms to implement and execute the process. The execution steps of a process may be carried out sequentially or in parallel, either by a person, team or through automation. The <strong>intelligence of the process</strong>—how it gets something accomplished—is embedded in the process design and does not require complex decision-making by the persons or automation agents executing the steps. In other words, the process designer converts the knowledge of an activity or task into well-defined sequence of steps and records the same in the process documentation. People or automation agents are only supposed to know <strong>how</strong> to execute the steps laid down in the process documentation, without having to understand <strong>why</strong> they are to be done. The <strong>key outcomes of a process</strong> are standardisation, speed, efficiency and automation.</p><p>Note 2: There is no rigid hierarchy between practices and processes. A practice can have multiple sub-practices and/ or processes. Usually, over time, many practice owners convert parts of their practice into processes with well-defined execution steps and enable them using automation.</p><p>Note 3: Everything need not be a practice or a process. For example, activities and tasks that are performed infrequently, or those that do not have clear sequence of steps, can just be accomplished without defining a practice or process for the same. It is also important that practices and processes should not become the end goal by themselves but should only help reach the end goal.</p><p>Note 4: Parameters and metrics to quantify and measure a practice or process are designed so as to help improve and maintain their performance and effectiveness.</p><h6 id=glossary_procedure>Procedure</h6><ul><li><p>specified way to carry out an activity or a process, which may or may not be documented. (ISO 9000:2015)</p></li><li><p>a specific and documented way of performing a task or activity, to ensure that it is carried out consistently in its defined manner.</p></li></ul><p>Note 1: A procedure typically outlines the detailed steps to be followed by an individual, a team or automation to perform a task or activity to achieve the required outcomes of the task or activity. Procedures are more prescriptive and granular than processes.</p><h6 id=glossary_guidelines>Guidelines</h6><ul><li>a type of document that provides recommendations or suggestions on how to achieve a particular outcome or meet certain objectives.</li></ul><p>Note 1: Guidelines are intended to help users interpret and apply the requirements and principles set out in the applicable policies and standards, and to provide guidance and best practices for specific applications or contexts.</p><h6 id=glossary_control>Control</h6><ul><li>a mechanism to ensure that an activity or process is performed as intended. It comprises of a set of actions that should be taken to manage risk, prevent or mitigate negative outcomes, and ensure that the system is functioning as required.</li></ul><p>Note 1: In the context of cybersecurity, a control is a measure implemented to reduce risk and protect information assets. The specific risk or issue being addressed defines the type of control(s) to be used, which may be administrative controls, such as policies and procedures, technical controls, such as role-based access permissions or physical controls, such as locks and alarms.</p><h6 id=glossary_control_purpose>Control objective/ purpose</h6><ul><li>a statement that defines what a control is intended to achieve.</li></ul><p>Note 1: A control objective is a specific and measurable outcome that is desired from a control. It provides the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the control in relation to the risks or issues that the management system is designed to address.</p><p>Note 2: Control objectives/ purposes are an important component of a management system, as they provide the basis for defining and designing controls. Effective control objectives help organisations ensure that their management system is functioning effectively and achieving their objectives.</p><h4 id=governance-terms>Governance Terms</h4><h6 id=accountable-iso-385002015>Accountable (ISO 38500:2015)</h6><ul><li>answerable for actions, decisions and performance.</li></ul><h6 id=accountability>Accountability</h6><ul><li><p>state of being accountable. Accountability relates to an allocated responsibility. The responsibility can be based on regulation or agreement or through assignment as part of delegation. (ISO 38500:2015)</p></li><li><p>the obligation to exercise authority that is based on established standards and to take ownership of the outcomes or results.</p></li></ul><p>Note 1: Authority can be delegated, Responsibility can be shared but cannot be delegated, Accountability can neither be shared nor delegated.</p><h6 id=aim-or-goal>Aim or Goal</h6><ul><li>the desired result of an effort. </li></ul><p>Note: In an entity/ organisational context, the term ‘mission’ is also used.</p><h6 id=audit>Audit</h6><ul><li>a structured, independent, and recorded method for gathering audit evidence and impartially assessing it to ascertain the degree of compliance with the audit standards.</li></ul><p>Note 1: Audits can be internal (first party), external (second-party or third-party), or combined audits (integrating multiple disciplines).</p><p>Note 2: An internal audit is carried out by the organization or by an external entity acting for the organization.</p><p>Note 3: The fundamental elements of an audit include the determination of the conformity of an object according to a procedure carried out by personnel not being responsible for the object audited.</p><p>Note 4: An internal audit may serve management review and other in-house functions and may underpin an organization&rsquo;s self-declaration of compliance. Independence in this context is demonstrated by the auditor&rsquo;s lack of involvement in the activities under review. External audits encompass both second and third-party evaluations. Second-party audits are performed by parties with a vested interest in the organization, like clients or their representatives. Third-party audits are carried out by independent external bodies, such as certification authorities or regulatory agencies.</p><p>Note 5: This constitutes one of the common terms and core definitions of the high-level structure for ISO management system standards. The original definition has been modified by adding Notes 3 and 4 to entry.</p><h6 id=authority>Authority</h6><ul><li>the right or power assigned to an individual or a government entity in order to achieve defined goals and objectives.
