    "content": "The digitalisation initiatives across India have increased significantly, bringing enhanced national productivity, efficiency, growth and quality of service. At the same time, a manifold increase in adverse cyber incidents pose serious danger to the nation’s well-being. Cyber-attacks on critical information infrastructure by organised criminal groups, non-state and state sponsored groups can cause debilitating impact to national security, economy, public health and public safety.\nThe critical sector entities (CSEs) that own, run, and manage their critical information infrastructure (CII) are solely responsible for the protection of their computer resources (systems, networks, applications, data repositories and identities). The entities are expected and required to use appropriate technology, implement various best practices and build a competent workforce to achieve a high level of cyber resilience.\nCSEs and other organisations would benefit from a generic framework for cyber resilience that harmonises the government and regulatory guidelines, directives and global best practices.\nFederated System Covergence of Perspectives Every organisation has a complex mix of stakeholders, both internal and external, each having their own specific roles, functions, backgrounds, competence and limitations. All stakeholders should be able to communicate, both orally and written, their respective perspectives clearly for others to understand. A well-defined and comprehensive “Glossary of terms and definitions” will enable all the stakeholders to communicate their respective viewpoints without ambiguity and misunderstanding, leading to faster and better convergence of perspectives and improving the decision process at all levels.",
