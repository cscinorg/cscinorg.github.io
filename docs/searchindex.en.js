    "content": "The interconnected and digitalised world requires a constant alignment of an enterprise’s mission, objectives, and functions with the larger context of the national, regional, and sectoral ecosystem in which the enterprise or organisation operates. The external context of an entity includes the customers/ users of an entity’s services, as well as the suppliers, auditors and supporting agencies. In the case of regulated entities and CSEs, the national bodies, viz. the government, regulators, nodal agencies, and other authorities, are important stakeholders/ interested parties, having legal, regulatory, oversight and advisory responsibilities over the entities.\nThe Ecosystem In modern business, it is very rare that an entity operates in isolation. Besides the customers and users and national bodies, the regulated and critical sector entities provide or use the services of other external entities in a cooperative, coordinated, or federated manner. In addition, the entities also connect with their suppliers and service providers by means of various “channels” and operate using a variety of federated business processes. This business ecosystem is termed in this documentation as functional business ecosystem of an entity.\nThe business ecosystem of an entity can also be described in terms of the use of IT in the provisioning and consumption of business services, the underlying business processes and information flows between the entity and its users, customers, partners, service providers and national bodies. This technology ecosystem is widely applicable in today’s digital environment and is termed in this documentation as federated digital ecosystem of an entity.\nThe business and digital ecosystems of an entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:\nEach organisation in the federated ecosystem is responsible for its own IT and information security. The organisations however must be aware and responsive to the information security needs of other participating entities within the federated ecosystem, and comply with directions, guidelines and standards prescribed by law, regulation, and mandates of nodal agencies. Every organisation in the complex, federated ecosystem is ultimately responsible for carrying out due diligence, not only about its own information security but also with respect to all parties in its external context.\nThe National Cyberspace A pictoral view of the national cyberspace is shown below:\nThe pictorial above describes the digital ecosystem elements (blobs) of the national cyberspace from an ownership perspective (who uses, owns, manages and controls what). Usage, ownership, management and control of elements of the digital ecosystem are important criteria to assess the trustworthiness and risk associated with the elements, specifically from the perspective of external threats.\nEntities can populate a blank diagram with their own information infrastructure components (web portals, email system, ERP, CRM, OEM subscriptions \u0026 support etc) and get a high level perspective of their digital landscape.\nSmart, Resilient and Sustainable The business and digital ecosystems of critical sector entities are highly complex and fast evolving. Generally, the top leadership of entities have a good grasp and understanding of the business complexities and are able to handle them well. However, the complexities of the digital ecosystem are not well understood by the top leadership and it is left to the CIOs, CISOs and their teams to handle the same. In most cases the technical and project teams adopt a technology-driven approach, which leads to misalignment between the business needs and the capabilities provided by the underlying digital ecosystem.\nThe integration of IT at the sectoral, regional, and national levels will only increase in future. Hence, at the national level, there is need to develop capabilities for a smart, resilient, and sustainable digital ecosystem. These terms are described below:\n‘Smart’ describes the high levels of automation, analytics and decision support capabilities that are enabled by the use of IT.\n‘Resilient’ describes the ability of the IT ecosystem to not only withstand large scale attacks and mitigate its destructive power but also the capability to recover from a successful attack in the shortest possible time with minimal damage or disruption.\n‘Sustainable’ describes the ability of the critical sector entities and the nation as a whole to be able to use IT for delivery of national critical functions and business services efficiently and effectively over a long period of time that extends into decades.\nIn general, smart capabilities are achieved through the use of intelligent devices, analytics, AI, and machine learning, which can significantly improve the functioning, performance and resilience of the digital ecosystem. Automation agents and bots provide an infinitely scalable non-human workforce that can complement the limited human workforce. Resilience is a key component of business and organisational needs and achieved through well-designed operating procedures, processes, and practices. Sustainability is achieved through a combination of institutional structures, people, policies, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) mechanisms.\nStrategic Program Approach Resilience and sustainability of IT and Information Security are strategic goals of organisations. Hence, they must be driven by the top leadership and management, who must take a long-term strategic view of both the use of IT to achieve business objectives and use of Information and Cyber Security to protect IT and business. Governing bodies and top leadership should assess whether they have adequate in-house capabilities to strategise on these two goals or they require external expertise to support their leaders and teams.\nA smart, resilient, and sustainable federated digital ecosystem is best achieved through a strategic program approach that regularly addresses all issues related to the following:\nProtect information and information infrastructure in cyberspace. Minimise vulnerabilities and risks through proactive actions. Build capabilities to prevent and rapidly respond to cyber incidents. Minimise damage and ensure fast recovery from cyber-attacks.",

    "content": "Purpose The purpose of this site is to inform and guide the leadership, management and workforce of critical sector entities (CSEs), from a practitioner’s perspective, on various aspects related to the use, security and resilience of their digital ecosystem. The content is also useful to entities of other sectors too.\nBackground Over the last two decades, India has transformed itself into a highly digitalised nation that has embedded Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) deeply into almost all aspects of our lives. We now have a vibrant national cyberspace, which manifests through a digital ecosystem formed by geographically dispersed, interconnected and federated conglomeration of systems, networks, data repositories, applications, devices, processes and services.\nThe cyberspace is vital to national security, economy, public health, public safety and overall national well-being. The digital ecosystem enables critical sector entities and other organisations to deliver the national critical functions through business and industrial processes that use the digital infrastructure. Hence, it is essential to build, maintain and continually improve the resilience of the digital ecosystem of our critical sectors through a coordinated approach. Any loss of trust in the same has severe consequences for users and other stakeholders of the national cyberspace.\nThe critical sectors in India are listed below:\nBanking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) Telecom Government Power and Energy (P\u0026E) Transport Strategic and Public Enterprises (S\u0026PE) Health Defence Examples of critical functions provided through the cyberspace in India are listed below:\nBanking, financial market investments, payments, clearing, settlement, and insurance services. Voice and data connectivity and internet services. E-Governance services. Control, operation and management of utility services like power, fuel, gas, smart cities etc. Control, operation and management of transportation services like railway/ metro, air traffic, ports etc. Services related to defence, internal security, public safety, and law enforcement. Public health related services. The IT Act 2000 (amended 2008) applies to users and providers of the digital ecosystem, including home users, MSMEs, large enterprises, government \u0026 non-government entities. It was framed to help secure the digital ecosystem while in use by the government, businesses and others for their service delivery, business and organisational functions.\nThe IT Act recognises that the basic responsibility for protecting an entity’s information infrastructure lies with the entity itself. It envisages the possible threats to the digital ecosystem during its use and provides direction and guidance for its protection. Relevant Rules have been framed under the IT Act to enable designated cybersecurity agencies like NCIIPC and CERT-In to oversee, monitor and respond to cyber attacks from malicious threat actors onto the critical information infrastructure (CII) and the larger digital ecosystem. There are other Acts and Rules that mandate sector regulators and other authorities to provide regulatory frameworks to secure the critical sectors and build cyber resilience in critical sector entities under their jurisdiction.\nSecuring the national cyberspace is a collective effort. The public and private entities that own, run, and manage their information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of the same. The intent of the Government is to ensure that adequate checks and balances are implemented, through appropriate legislations, policies and guidelines, for secure and resilient operations of the critical functions and their underlying critical information infrastructure. The intent of national nodal agencies and sectoral regulators is to ensure that cyber risk is appropriately managed in the sectors, to the level demanded by the national interest.\nStructure The site’s documentation section is divided into multiple chapters and topics that reflect the perspectives, concerns and needs of different stakeholders within and across critical sector entities and other organisations.\nThe Notes, FAQs, Resources and Glossary sections will be populated over time. A Discussions platform is also set up through GitHub for feedback and community engagement.\nContext Cyber-attacks on critical information infrastructure by organised criminal groups, non-state and state sponsored groups can cause debilitating impact to national security, economy, public health and public safety. The critical sector entities that own, run, and manage their critical information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of their computer resources (systems, networks, applications, data repositories and identities). The entities are expected and required to use appropriate technology, implement various best practices and build a competent workforce to achieve a high level of cyber resilience.\nThe CSEs and other organisations have no dearth of information and guidance from multiple sources to help them secure their IT systems and networks. Yet, a large number of them continue to suffer downtime and losses due to cyber-attacks. An analysis of successful attacks indicate that most of them succeeded because the entities did not or could not apply the cybersecurity information and guidance effectively. A common refrain from cybersecurity experts and empanelled auditors is that a large number of entities have negligible or poor implementation of basic and essential cybersecurity controls. It looks as if the entities “do not understand” or “do not want to implement” cybersecurity.\nInteraction with business leaders, managers and the non-IT workforce of entities provides a different perspective. The underlying message from these interactions is that they are unable to integrate cybersecurity into their way of thinking and working – organisational hierarchy, business impact analysis, roles and responsibilities, practices and processes, management systems, reporting structures, RACI etc. Cybersecurity is seen as a technical function that is best carried out by technology experts.\nEvery organisation has a complex mix of internal and external workforce and other stakeholders, each having their own specific roles, functions, backgrounds, competence and limitations. However, everyone understands the concept of business resilience and can therefore grasp the concept of cyber resilience. Hence, it would be appropriate to convert cybersecurity discussions into cyber resilience discussions, to enable the participation of all stakeholders. This calls for\nA common vocabulary that business and technical stakeholders can both use to clearly communicate their respective perspectives, both orally and in writing, without ambiguity and misunderstanding, A shared understanding leads to faster and better convergence of perspectives and improving the decision process at all levels. A cyber resilience framework that harmonises business, IT and cybersecurity perspectives, as also government and regulatory guidelines, directives and global best practices. This site attempts to address the two themes mentioned above. A common vocabulary is provided through a glossary of terms and definitions that both business and technical users can use. The chapters and topics address various aspects of cyber resilience, covering institutional structures, people, policies, procedures, practices and processes, technology and collaboration. Cybersecurity is addressed as an enabler of speed, safety and resilience in protection, detection, response, and recovery to attacks on our cyberspace, especially the attacks on our critical sectors.\nMany of the insights and perspectives are derived from the practices and processes adopted by organisations having a high level of cybersecurity capability and maturity. Organisations should take this documentation as a generic framework that is further adapted for their specific requirements.\nNote Pictorial representations in the documents are indicative and should be used for triggering discussions on different perspectives.\nContact For queries, suggestions and feedback, please contact the site administrator at admin@cscin.org.in.",
