    "content": "Enterprise Architecture is a discipline that provides a holistic and integrated view of an organisation’s strategy, processes, information, and technology. This enterprise approach enables the alignment of various components of the business to work cohesively towards common goals. Within the Enterprise Architecture Framework, ‘enterprise’ can be understood in two key contexts:\nThe broad spectrum of the enterprise, inclusive of all people, processes, and technology A particular domain within the enterprise, such as a specific business unit or functional area. In both scenarios, the architecture spans multiple of systems and encompasses numerous departments within the organisation. When the objective is to create a cohesive network that includes the extended enterprise, it involves not only the internal divisions but also external entities such as partners, suppliers, and customers.\nThe aim of enterprise architecture as a framework is to optimise the often-fragmented legacy of processes across the enterprise (both manual and automated) into an integrated and secure environment that is responsive to changes and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy.\nThis section provides a reference framework to governing bodies and top management of regulated and critical sector entities to establish ‘due diligence’ on the use of IT in their respective entities. It describes the Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) at two levels, viz:\nEnterprise Business Architecture Framework (EBAF). Enterprise Technology Architecture Framework (ETAF). The business architecture context is about how the organisation delivers value to its stakeholders. The technology architecture frameworks are about using technology to support the business mission, goals, objectives, and functions.\nEnterprise Business Architecture Framework Overview The Enterprise Business Architecture Framework (EBAF) presents an end-to-end methodology that strategically aligns an organisation’s goals with its operational activities. Serving as an architectural blueprint, it guides leaders in shaping the processes, systems, and data flows central to the enterprise’s functioning. By integrating various components of business—ranging from customer interactions to technological infrastructure—EBAF aims to create an environment that is both streamlined and agile, fostering a business structure that is efficient and swiftly responsive to evolving demands.\nAt its core, the purpose of EBAF is to provide a structured yet flexible means for articulating and implementing a business’s architecture that resonates with its strategic imperatives. This involves offering clear guidance for continuous improvement of operational processes, aligning every business move with strategic goals. Beyond merely enhancing operational effectiveness, the framework serves as a catalyst to reduce process redundancies and drive enterprise-wide efficiency, ensuring that all actions taken are deliberate and goal-oriented.\nIncorporating a strong emphasis on security, EBAF also propels organisations to proactively address potential risks and integrate robust security measures into their business architecture. This security-minded approach is essential in safeguarding critical information and systems, ensuring resilience against threats, and maintaining trust with stakeholders. To reinforce business resilience and foster innovation, EBAF pursuits with compliance and governance, permitting the safe exploration of new technologies and practices within a secure architectural landscape. Effectively, EBAF not only ensures that organisations meet regulatory requirements but also establish a secure foundation for growth and transformation.\nThe Business Ecosystem The business ecosystem of an entity describes its environment in terms of its functions and activities in relation to and with the participation of other entities and national bodies. The business ecosystem of an entity can also be described in terms of the use of IT in the provisioning and consumption of business services, the underlying business processes and information flows between the entity and its users, customers, partners, service providers and national bodies.\nBusiness ecosystem of regulated and critical sector entities in Indian context is pictorially shown here.\nEnterprise Technology Architecture Framework The federated digital ecosystem of a CSE is manifested through an information infrastructure that runs the business, industrial and operational processes. Most of the currently available technical literature and knowledge focuses on differentiating the characteristics and technical architectures of IT, OT, IIoT and Information Security systems and networks. In contrast, this documentation attempts to synergise and harmonise the differentiated concepts and frameworks into a common representation that can help in better communication amongst the business, non-technical and technical stakeholders, both within and outside the organisations.\nThe enterprise technology architecture framework outlined in this section offers a unified reference for top and senior management of organisations and national nodal bodies. It is designed to facilitate informed decision-making on leveraging technology to achieve desired business results, establish best practices, and provide comprehensive guidance on functional, performance, operational, managerial, and security considerations. It may be noted that the word “technology” here refers specifically to IT, OT, and Information Security related technology, as well as IIoT technology used for physical access control and monitoring (e.g., smart cards, biometrics, CCTVs etc).\nConcepts Requirements for use of Technology The enterprise technology architecture framework of organisations should address the following requirements so that IT and OT are used efficiently, effectively, safely and securely:\nFunctional: Deliver the business and industrial objectives through functions, processes, operations, and services.\nQuality: Deliver the required quality of systems and software.\nPerformance: Deliver required performance of the functions and processes.\nTrustworthiness: Assurance that the functionality is implemented and configured correctly and is operating as intended.\nCybersecurity: There are no weaknesses and vulnerabilities in hardware/ firmware/ software that could be exploited by malicious actors to cause harm.\nConfidentiality: The information and data are handled as per its security classification.\nIntegrity: The data and processes are trustable.\nAvailability: The functions and performance are available to the users at required levels of availability. Safety: Specific to OT and IIoT, the assurance that the operational processes are safe for humans and the environment.\nPrivacy: Privacy of individuals and organisations is maintained, with regard to sensitive and private information.\nSupply chain: Assurance that the entire supply chain is secure and not exploitable for causing harm.\nManagement: People, process, and technology governance, which oversees and assures that the above parameters are consistently achieved throughout the life cycle.\nEcosystem: The organisation’s digital infrastructure does not cause harm to other organisations that are part of the federated digital ecosystem.\nArchitectural Principles The IT, OT and IS infrastructure implementation is based upon a common set of engineering and architectural principles, namely:\nSegmentation: Zoning of assets, network, and resources (security by design, security in implementation).\nMulti-layered security: Implementing a layered security cover to achieve defence in depth.\nReliability: Ability to assure a required level of functionality and performance in normal circumstances.\nRobustness: Ability to deliver a minimum level of functionality and performance in the face of adversity.\nResilience: Ability to prevent the degradation of functions, performance, and trustworthiness; ability to minimise the impact of degradation (if it occurs) and ability to quickly recover from a degraded condition to the normal condition.\nPatterns of a CSE’s Information Infrastructure Almost all CSEs implement their information (IT, OT and IS) infrastructure through separate projects. Typical elements of an CSE’s information infrastructure, its operation, management, and use are described below:\nA common information infrastructure across the entity, whose elements include hardware and software (end-user devices, mail, web, and portal servers), network and security systems, and information services (email, portal, common user applications, databases etc). The in-store and in-use assets are usually managed through ERP/ ITAM/ ITOM/ CMDB platforms.\nThe common information infrastructure is managed through pan-organisation IT Operations/ Service management (ITOM/ ITSM) and Information Security management systems (ISMS).\nThe platforms have their own IT infrastructure, viz, devices and runtime platforms to carry out IT and IS management functions related to asset configurations, availability and performance, patches and upgrades, compliance to hardening baselines, identity and access, authentication and authorisation, systems and network management, security management, logs and audit trails (evidence management), vulnerability and compliance management, security incident and event management (SIEM), incident response management, (IR, EDR/ XDR, SOAR), analytics etc. Devices, systems, platforms, networks, security, applications, and databases of critical processes are usually segregated into secure logical or physical (air-gapped) high-trust zones.\nAir-gapped high-trust zones would typically have their own management systems, while non-air-gapped high-trust zones may be managed through the pan-organisation management systems.\nIntegration of the security related components of physical infrastructure, viz physical access control (biometrics and smart cards), physical surveillance (CCTV networks) and management of critical non-IT asset dependencies (BIMS, UPS, Generators etc) of data centres.\nWorkforce required to operate, manage, and secure the information infrastructure.\nUsers, both humans and machines, who access the information infrastructure for i) consuming services, ii) carrying out system administration and management, or iii) providing service, such as technical support or customer service.\nA generic deployment is pictorially represented below. It depicts the computer resources and management/ operational platforms of an entity’s IT/ OT/ IIoT infrastructure. The terms ‘non-critical’ and ‘critical’ are only indicative of how entities classify their processes and thereby, the underlying IT/ OT/ IIoT infrastructure of the processes.\nThe “levels” in the diagram represent the functional aspect of the infrastructure components, as tabulated below.\nLevel Description Reference IT, OT Elements Reference IS Elements 0 Systems, which carry out specific functions by themselves. They do not manage any other computer resources. In physical terms, these are computer resources, typically specific hardware/ appliance/ software application. IT systems, OT devices, applications, networks elements, data repositories Security systems like Firewall, HIPS, NIPS, IDS, Endpoint Agents 1 Platforms, which carry out management functions, viz, manage the functions of or by L0 systems. Management functions are typically restricted to one class. In physical terms, a platform is typically an integration of more than one computer resource, such as hardware, OS, web server, app server, database server, portal etc. IT-GRC, ITAM, ITOM, CMDB, DNS, DHCP, Domain Controllers, Patch Managers, SCADA, DCS, Data Historians, OT HMI IdAM, Policy, Certificate \u0026 Key Management, NAC, EPP, EDR, AV Manager, Syslog Aggregator 2 Platforms, which enable an entity to carry out operational processing and analytics on short-term data and information from L0 and L1 systems/ platforms.\nKey differentiators between L1 and L2 are: a) L2 platforms enable automation of processes at the entity level. b) L2 platforms have a richer variety of integration mechanisms with different L0 systems, L1 platforms and external systems/ feeds etc. In physical terms, these platforms comprise of a set of computer resources, viz hardware and software applications. NMS and EMS IT Service Management (ITSM) Incident Response (IR) Management System\nBusiness Continuity Management System (BCMS) SIEM and SOAR Information Security Management System (ISMS) Cyber Security Incident Response Management System\nThreat Intelligence Platform (TIP) 3 Platforms, which enable an entity to carry out deep analytics using statistical and AI/ML techniques on long-term data and information from L0 to L2 systems/ platforms.\nKey differentiators between L2 and L3 are: a) L2 platforms are focused on providing operational analytics, while L3 platform focusses on strategic and long-term analytics. b) L3 platform can carry out some functions of L2 platform, in case L2 platform is not available. For example, SIEM analytics and SOAR functions. In physical terms, these platforms comprise of a set of computer resources, viz hardware and software applications. Enterprise Datawarehouse and Analytical Processing Systems, without or with AI and ML capabilities Enterprise Security Data Lake and Security Analytics Systems, without or with AI and ML capabilities Terms and Definitions The following terms and definitions are used in this document to describe an entity’s enterprise-wide information infrastructure in a generalised manner.\nResources: These are the physical and logical assets that are in-use by an entity or user for computing, storage, networking and other IT, OT and IS functions. It corresponds to the term “Computer Resource” in the IT Act 2000 (revised 2008).\nData Centre premises: a generic term to describe a geographical site, which hosts the computing, storage, internal networking, and other resources that an entity uses to deliver business services and carry out its business functions and operations. Server rooms are equivalent to micro data centres.\nUser premises: a generic term to describe a geographical site, which hosts the computing, storage, internal networking, and other resources that are used by users (human and machine) to connect to the data centres to access services. Users may be consumers of service, systems administrators, or providers of service. The providers of service include technical support and customer service teams etc.\nData Centre constituents: a generic term to describe the different constituents of a typical data centre, such as the property on which the data centre is built, the data centre facility, non-IT and IT constituents within the data centre and connectivity from/to the data centre. Typically, each of the constituents are evaluated when strategic decisions are taken regarding the data centres.\nNetwork Infrastructure Resources: the in-use network infrastructure resources can be described on the basis of the following characteristics:\nCommunication media: copper, optical fibre (OFC), power line carrier communication (PLCC), Optical Power Ground Wire (OPGW) on power transmission lines, HF/ VHF/ UHF, microwave, and satellite links. - WAN communication protocols: PDH, SONET/ SDH, Metro Ethernet, xDSL, AON/PON, MPLS, IP, power sector communication protocols like IEC 60870 and 61850 series/ DNP/ Modbus/ RTU, OSGP, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), GPRS, 4G, 5G.\nNetwork topologies: point to point, point to multipoint star, mesh, or bus topology.\nNetwork device functions: transmission, switching, routing, element and network management, network security etc.\nNetwork Provider infrastructure: a generic term to describe one or many geographical sites, which hosts the network infrastructure resources that lies outside of the data centre and user premises. The network infrastructure is owned by a network provider entity (TSP, ISP). The data centre and user premises use customer premises equipment (CPEs) to connect to the network provider infrastructure. The CPEs themselves may be customer-owned or provider-owned.\nZone: a generic term zone is defined as a grouping of logical or physical assets that share common security requirements based on factors such as criticality and consequence. This definition has been generalised in this document to describe groups of in-use IT, OT and IS resources within data centre or user premises, the physical or logical grouping being done as per functional, operational, management or security requirements.\nPerimeter: a physical or logical boundary wall between two zones, which also has access controls (gates) for ingress into and egress out of the zones. Physical access control is relevant for premises, while logical access controls are relevant for systems and networks. Conduit: a generic term conduit is defined as grouping of assets dedicated exclusively to communications and which share the same security requirements. In this document it describes the communication channels connecting the zones and also the tunnels through the perimeter that separates two zones. Examples of the latter are VPN tunnels and data diode.\nOntology of Tags for Enterprise Information Infrastructure Governing bodies, top and senior management and the technical heads in entities are provided with a common vocabulary to represent the use of IT within the entity. The ontology for tagging an enterprise’s information infrastructure has three tag-groups, viz resource categorisation tag group, hierarchical level tag group and trust level tag group.\nThe ontology is technologically agnostic so that it can understood by both business and technical persons. The tags are meant to be used in architecture diagrams and presentations of business and technical management to describe the use of IT, both for their internal decision processes and for communication with external entities. The tagging enables non-technical personnel to assimilate the context and participate in decision-making.\nResource Categorisation Tags The resource categorisation tags help the stakeholders to represent the ownership and control that an entity has over its information infrastructure elements. The following tags are in this group:\nResource zones - central (S) or end-user (U). In-use resources purpose and use – functional (FS, FU) or governance/ management/ administration (GS, GU). Connectivity zones (V). Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD). Connectivity ownership (VA, VB, VC, VD). Connectivity purpose and use (XA, XB, XC, XD). End user resource ownership (UA, UB, UC, UD). End user role (NU, OU). Control over human workforce (WA, WB, WC, WD). Services (DC, IS, OS, TS, SS, FM). Service ownership (JA, JB, JC, JD). Data centre segmentation (ML1 to ML4). Cloud services segmentation (YL0 to YL4) Sample Use Case for Resource Categorization Tags Scenario:\nA CSE wants to implement a new Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) to streamline its IT infrastructure, operations, and governance.\nChallenge:\nThe organisation’s resources are diverse and distributed across various departments, zones, and functions. The complexity of managing these resources often leads to inefficiencies, lack of clarity in ownership, and difficulty in governance. There is an immediate need for a system that can simplify the categorisation and understanding of these resources for all relevant stakeholders, while also supporting the implementation of the new EAF.\nSolution:\nTo address this challenge, the organisation decides to employ a set of resource categorization tags within their EAF. These tags act as labels that allow for easy identification and categorisation of resources, helping stakeholders to better understand the purpose, ownership, governance and threat modelling of each resource within the enterprise infrastructure.\nImplementation:\nResource Zones Tags: Tags like ‘Central (S)’ for shared resources and ‘End-User (U)’ for individual user-specific resources simplify the location and accessibility of resource classification for stakeholders.\nPurpose and Use Tags: Tags such as ‘functional (FS, FU)’ for operational resources and ‘governance/management/administration (GS, GU)’ for resources related to the oversight and control efficiently distinguish between the functional aspects of resources and their governance.\nConnectivity and Ownership Tags: Tags like ‘Connectivity zones (V)’ and ‘Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD)’ offer clarity on the connective infrastructure and its proprietors, expediting responsibility allocation and incident resolution. Similarly, ‘Connectivity ownership (VA, VB, VC, VD)’ and ‘End user resource ownership (UA, UB, UC, UD)’ tags provide precise ownership details.\nPurpose Specific Tags: With the inclusion of ‘Connectivity purpose and use (XA, XB, XC, XD)’ and ‘End user role (NU, OU)’ tags, the utility function and user role associated with the resources are effortlessly communicated, ensuring right access and use.\nWorkforce and Services Tags: Tags regarding ‘Control over human workforce (WA, WB, WC, WD)’ denote the degree of control and structure within the workforce, while ‘Services (DC, IS, OS, TS, SS, FM)’ and ‘Service ownership (JA, JB, JC, JD)’ deliver insights regarding the service allocation and control, amplifying the operational management.\nSegmentation Tags: Finally, tags related to ‘Data centre segmentation (ML1 to ML4)’ and ‘Cloud services segmentation (YL0 to YL4)’ offer clear distinctions within data management and cloud service levels, promoting effective and secured data governance.\nBenefits:\nClarity and Control: The tags provide clear direction on resource governance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the resources they oversee.\nStreamlined Infrastructure Management: The use of tags streamlines the complexity associated with managing an extensive array of resources.\nEffective Governance: With tags categorising resources based on their purpose and governance, it becomes easier to enforce policies and maintain compliance.\nEnhanced Stakeholder Communication: Tags serve as a common language simplifying communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders regarding resource management.\nAgile Resource Allocation: Tags enable agile and accurate resource allocation, matching resources to needs more effectively.\nAn illustrative use of resource categorisation tags is given below.\nHierarchical Level Tags The hierarchical level tags are designed to have a common classification of the information infrastructure into well-defined hierarchical zones. Appropriate trust levels can be assigned to the zones. This will help the project design and engineering teams, procurement, and provisioning teams, IT and information security operations management teams and the service providers in better risk analysis and allocation of various resources. The following tags are in this group:\nCentral resource hierarchy of zones (HL0 to HL5). Perimeter zones between hierarchical zones (PHL1 to PHL4.5). Perimeter zones in data centre segments (PM1 to PM4). Perimeter zones in cloud environment (PYL0 to PYL4). Sample Use Case for Hierarchical Level Tags Scenario:\nAn organisation is in the process of adopting a new Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF) to bolster its IT and OT infrastructure’s efficiency, security, and governance. A key challenge they face in this deployment is managing the complexity and diversity of their information infrastructure, which includes various hierarchical zones, data centre segments, and cloud environments.\nChallenge:\nProject design and engineering teams, alongside procurement, provisioning, IT and OT operations management, and service providers, struggle with conducting effective risk analysis and resource allocation due to the intricate nature of the infrastructure layout and the varying levels of trust associated with each zone. The IT and OT teams must also be able to converge onto a common representation of their respective hierarchies.\nSolution:\nIn addressing these challenges, the organisation opts to implement hierarchical level tags within their EAF. These tags help to classify the information infrastructure into hierarchical zones with assigned trust levels. This tagging enables the stakeholders to clearly segment the IT and OT resources, aiding in threat modelling, risk analysis and the strategic allocation of resources across zones.\nImplementation:\nCentral Resource Hierarchy Tags: Tags ranging from ‘Central resource hierarchy of zones (HL0 to HL5)’ clearly delineate the core infrastructure zones, establishing a graded structure of trust and access controls that escalate with each hierarchy level.\nPerimeter Zone Tags: ‘Perimeter zones between hierarchical zones (PHL1 to PHL4.5)’ tags facilitate a distinct border identification between hierarchical zones, serving as checkpoints for security assessments and transitions in trust levels.\nData Centre and Cloud Perimeter Tags: Tags like ‘perimeter zones in data centre segments (PM1 to PM4)’ and ‘perimeter zones in cloud environment (PYL0 to PYL4)’ categorize resources within data centres and cloud segments. These tags help stakeholder teams evaluate and address specific security concerns more accurately within these venues based on the designated trust levels.\nBenefits:\nImproved Risk Management: Hierarchical tags aid in identifying and managing potential risks associated with the varying zones, thus enhancing the overall security posture.\nStreamlined Resource Deployment: The tags create an organized structure that simplifies the understanding of where resources reside and their respective trust levels.\nInformed Decision-Making: Teams gain insights into infrastructure vulnerabilities and strengths, enabling them to make more strategic decisions about resource deployment and protection.\nEffective Collaboration: A common classification system assists diverse teams in synchronizing their efforts, thus facilitating collaboration, and reducing inconsistencies.\nEnhanced Security Profiles: Each resource carries a clear security profile through tagging, accommodating tailored security measures.\nAn illustrative use of resource categorisation tags is given below.\nTrust Level Tags The trust level tags represent the level of trust that can be assigned to a zone. This will help the project design and engineering teams, IT and information security operations management teams and the service providers to design, implement, operate and manage zoning, segmentation and zero trust architecture. The following tags are in this group:\n‒ Trust level (TL0 to TL5)\nSampe Use Case for Trust Level Tags Overview:\nAn organization plans to implement zero trust in its enterprise IT. Stakeholders include IT architects, security officers, network administrators, and management teams who must understand and enforce the security policies, zoning and segmentation within the organization’s operations effectively.\nChallenge:\nVaried levels of data sensitivity and diverse IT systems across the enterprise create a complex security landscape that requires a clear and uniform approach to managing trust and control levels. Stakeholders require a reliable method for identifying, at a glance, the security trust levels and enforcement strength for each zone to correctly implement and adhere to security policies, controls, and compliance requirements.\nSolution:\nTrust level tags serve as a simple and effective way to categorise and label the components of the organisation’s resource and connectivity zones based on defined security policies and the level of control the entity has or requires. These tags help stakeholders instantly recognise the importance and sensitivity of each zone, ultimately guiding their risk management and policy enforcement actions.\nImplementation:\nDefining Trust Levels: Categorise and define security trust levels ranging from TL0 to TL5. Establish criteria for each level based on the level of control the entity has/ can have over the zone\nEvaluating and Tagging Resource Zones: Assess each resource zone within the organisation and determine the appropriate trust level. Apply the respective trust level tag to systems, databases, and networks accordingly.\nEvaluating and Tagging Connectivity Zones: Analyse network segments and connectivity frameworks for security enforcement capability and requirements. Assign trust level tags that match their security policy framework.\nIncorporating into EAF documentation: Update all related architecture diagrams, policies, and procedural documents with the applied trust level tags to create a standard reference across the organisation, ensuring coherence and mutual understanding among all stakeholders responsible for zero trust.\nBenefits:\nEnhanced Risk Management: Trust levels guide stakeholders toward adequately securing each zone according to its criticality and the organization’s risk tolerance.\nClear Communication: The standardized tagging system reduces complexity and eases the communication of security and compliance statuses across departments and teams.\nStreamlined Policy Enforcement: Clearly identified trust levels support consistent application of security measures and rapid adjustment to evolving threats.\nEfficient Compliance Monitoring: Tags make it easier to monitor adherence to internal and external compliance standards, enabling swift corrective measures as needed.\nOptimized Security Investments: By identifying zones with higher trust levels, the organization can prioritize security investments and focus resources where they are most impactful.\nAn illustrative use of trust level tags in a business ecosystem diagram is given below. The trust level tags can be similarly used in a federated digital ecosystem diagram.",

    "content": "The digital ecosystems of modern enterprises are large and complex, usually spread geographically across the country and the world. The ecosystems encompass a large number and variety of technologies, products, platforms, systems, networks, applications, databases and services, which may be deployed on-premises, on cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) or in hybrid mode.\nEnterprises usually have multiple teams of IT, OT, IIoT, information security and cybersecurity professionals and managers, who are responsible to carry out the organisations’ functions, activities and tasks related to the digital ecosystem of the organisation. CSEs and other organisations would derive significant benefits by establishing a strategic program and structured approach to ensure that their workforce and teams managing the digital ecosystem have the requisite cybersecurity competence (knowledge, skills and levels of expertise) to be effective in handling the entire gamut of work and responsibilities of IT, OT, IIoT, information security and cybersecurity.\nWorkforce Composition Given the size and complexity of digital ecosystem, it may be impractical for most CSEs and other organisations to depend solely upon their internal workforce to acquire, implement, engineer, operate, manage and sustain the ecosystem. In practice, the organisations have a composite workforce that has a mix of own employees, hired manpower, specialist (OEM, ISV, SI, SaaS) teams and resources of managed services providers (MSPs), who work together to carry out the functions, activities and tasks related to the digital ecosystem.\nWorkforce Hierarchy At an organisational level the digital ecosystem workforce can be divided into multiple levels of hierarchy, as given below. Typical job titles in each level indicate the associated job functions, tasks, and responsibilities.\nSenior management level – Vice Presidents, CTO, CIO, CISO, CSO, Heads of Business Units, Divisions, Departments.\nMiddle and lower management level – Project Managers, Technology Managers, Operations Managers, Security Managers, Cyber Defence Team Leads, NOC and SOC Team Leads, GRC Managers, Workforce Development Managers etc.\nIndividual Contributor level – Operators, Analysts, Administrators, Engineers, Specialists, Technicians, Architects, Developers, Testers, Quality Testers, Apprentices, Associates, Interns.\nSenior and middle level managerial roles are always assigned to employees of the organisations. Technical work and its deliverables could be assigned to external teams from OEMs, SIs, MSPs and other service providers, as long as the overall supervision and oversight is handled by designated senior and middle level managers of the organisation. The middle and lower management levels, and individual contributors, are accountable and responsible for day-to-day operational activities and tasks.\nNote The concept of “virtual managers” or “external advisors with C-level access” is gaining acceptance amongst many organisations, who need such services in a more flexible, scalable and cost-effective manner. The virtual manager, for example, a virtual chief information security officer (vCISO) performs most of the core functions as a traditional, full-time manager. They just differ in terms of their engagement model (part time) and presence (non-physical) in the organisation.\nWorkforce Specialisations The sheer breadth and variety of the digital ecosystem technologies, products, deployment models, processes and practices in an organisation makes it impossible for any professional to develop competency in every area. Organisations therefore require professionals with different specialisations to work together in teams. An illustrative list of knowledge and skill specialisation areas for the composite workforce is given below. Source: NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for Cybersecurity Professionals.\n. Knowledge and Skills Specialisation Areas Knowledge Area 1 Network Infrastructure \u0026 Network Security 2 Systems (HW, VM, Firmware, OS) Security 3 Software and Platform Operations Security 4 Secure Systems Engineering 5 Secure Software Design \u0026 Development 6 Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance 7 Enterprise Supply Chain 8 Enterprise IT and Information Security 9 Enterprise Cyber Defence and Security Operations 10 Data Analytics 11 Cyber Forensics 12 Cyber Security Training \u0026 Awareness 13 ICS Cyber Security Skills 1 Programming \u0026 Scripting 2 Managing and Securing Systems, Networks, Applications 3 Managing and Securing Information, Data And Identities 4 Custom Software Development and Management 5 Cyber Defence and Security Operations 6 Others (OEM/ ISV Technologies and Products) Each knowledge and skill area also has an expertise level (basic, intermediate, expert) associated with it. The expertise levels should generally be mapped to the workforce hierarchy, keeping in view the functions executed by a particular hierarchy of the workforce, the size of organisation and the complexity of their digital ecosystem. For example, junior levels are expected to acquire at least the basic level of expertise, while middle and senior levels are expected to acquire intermediate or expert level of expertise. Professionals working with the OEMs, ISVs, SIs, MSPs and other service providers are expected to have intermediate or expert level of expertise in their respective areas of specialisation.\nTip CSEs are advised to refer Appendix 1A of NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for Cybersecurity Professionals, which has a comprehensive and detailed table of knowledge, skills and expertise for each specialisation area of an organisation.\nFunctions The composite workforce of CSEs and other organisations carry out the five technical and five management functions on a daily or periodic basis. In practice, to enable proper distribution of work and responsibilities, the ten functions are sub-divided into different domains.\nDomains A domain in the context of workforce specialisations is a distinct technical/ organisational capability of processes, people and technology that a CSE must have to meet its IT and cyber security objectives successfully. Each domain typically has an organisational hierarchy associated with it that is designed to handle different levels of work and responsibilities. An illustrative diagram of IT and cybersecurity domains mapped to organisational teams is given below.\nJob Roles and associated Competencies An illustrative list of IT and cybersecurity job roles and job descriptions in an entity is given below. The knowledge, skills and expertise level required for each of the job roles is mentioned against each role in the form of codes that are taken from Appendix 1A of NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for Cybersecurity Professionals.\n.

KM-1201A\nSM-0601A, SM-0602F An illustrative reporting hierarchy for different job roles is given in the diagram below.\nThe generic top-most positions for different reporting hierarchies are described as under:\nChief Technology Officer (CTO) – Oversees the overall technology strategy, large project implementations and engineering functions. Chief Information Officer (CIO) – Oversees the IT operations and IT security functions. Chief Operations Officer (COO) - Many organisations with large OT/ ICS segments typically have separate COOs for overseeing the OT operations and OT security functions. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) – Oversees the IT Governance (Policies), Risk \u0026 Compliance (GRC) functions and information security (IS) operations. Highly specialised job roles like IT/ ICS GRC Strategist, Technology \u0026 System Security Architect, ICS Cyber Security Architect, Cyber Defence Strategist and Cyber Defence Architect are typically required in very large entities and consultancy organisations. Mid-sized and smaller CSEs may choose to contract their services on need- basis from consultancy organisations.\nCompetency Profiles and Certifications The Government has embarked upon capacity building of cybersecurity workforce through mechanisms such as academic and education programs and certification of competency profiles by internationally recognised accreditation and certification bodies. A number of academic programs for cybersecurity are already being conducted by leading universities. In addition, there are many global and national level certification programs that are run by different private bodies.\nAn indicative list of major international certifications is collated here. The list has been prepared, based on publicly available information, and has not been vetted for correctness and completeness. Suggestions for improvements and rectification of errors are welcome.\nGuidance on Workforce Capabilities Organisations are advised to adopt the following steps to align workforce competencies and certifications to different IT and cyberseecurity job roles:\nCategorise the organisation’s cyber security workforce requirements for different IT and cybersecurity domains and job roles, using the information of the work, activities and tasks that are listed against the job roles.\nMap the knowledge and skills specialisation areas and expertise levels that are considered essential for the job roles. Identify the appropriate set of competency certifications and/ or academic programs that cover the knowledge, skills and expertise requirements for the job roles.\nChoose a workforce composition mix that is most appropriate to achieve the IT and cybersecurity objectives of the organisation. The small and medium sized CSEs can club some of the job roles within Technical (Cybersecurity) vertical and the Technical (IT \u0026 ICS Security) vertical and assign it to one person with appropriate knowledge and skillsets. The clubbing of job roles across the above mentioned two verticals shall not be done.\nUse the job roles, job descriptions, knowledge and skills specialisation areas, expertise levels, competency certifications and academic programs to create appropriate job profiles for internal and/ or external hiring and/or for sourcing of competent workforce from service providers and consultancy organisations.\nUse the competency profiles (knowledge, skills and expertise levels) for different job roles to design training programs and if required for hiring training bodies to train the workforce in different cyber security domains, as part of capability and capacity development programs.\nUse the competency profile certifications provided by accredited bodies recommended by the government/national nodal agencies as a basis for selection. Use the competency profile certifications to demonstrate to the regulators and national agencies that cyber security personnel employed in critical IT \u0026 ICS domains have the required competence to carry out the respective job role responsibilities.",

    "content": "The Ecosystem The interconnected and digitalised world requires a constant alignment of an enterprise’s mission, objectives, and functions with the larger context of the national, regional, and sectoral ecosystem in which the enterprise or organisation operates. The external context of an entity includes the customers/ users of an entity’s services, as well as the suppliers, auditors and supporting agencies. In the case of regulated entities and CSEs, the national bodies, viz. the government, regulators, nodal agencies, and other authorities, are important stakeholders/ interested parties, having legal, regulatory, oversight and advisory responsibilities over the entities.\nIn modern business, it is very rare that an entity operates in isolation. Besides the customers and users and national bodies, the regulated and critical sector entities provide or use the services of other external entities in a cooperative, coordinated, or federated manner. In addition, the entities also connect with their suppliers and service providers by means of various “channels” and operate using a variety of federated business processes. This business ecosystem is termed in this documentation as functional business ecosystem of an entity.\nThe business ecosystem of an entity can also be described in terms of the use of IT in the provisioning and consumption of business services, the underlying business processes and information flows between the entity and its users, customers, partners, service providers and national bodies. This technology ecosystem is widely applicable in today’s digital environment and is termed in this documentation as federated digital ecosystem of an entity.\nBusiness and Digital Ecosystems The business and digital ecosystems of an entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:\nEach organisation in the federated ecosystem is responsible for its own IT and information security. The organisations however must be aware and responsive to the information security needs of other participating entities within the federated ecosystem, and comply with directions, guidelines and standards prescribed by law, regulation, and mandates of nodal agencies. Every organisation in the complex, federated ecosystem is ultimately responsible for carrying out due diligence, not only about its own information security but also with respect to all parties in its external context.\nThe National Cyberspace The federated digital ecosystem is a manifestation of the national cyberspace. A pictorial view of the national cyberspace is shown below:\nThe digital ecosystem elements (blobs) give visual representation of the national cyberspace from an usage and ownership perspective (who uses, owns, provides, manages and controls what). Ownership, management and control of elements of the digital ecosystem are important criteria to assess the trustworthiness and risk associated with the elements, specifically from the perspective of external threats.\nDecomposing the Ecosystem The business and digital ecosystems of critical sector entities are highly complex and continually evolving. However, for ease of understanding, they can be decomposed into the following four levels:\nGovernance Business Technology Physical The pictorial ecosystem is further decomposed into the four levels and described in greater detail.\nTip Entities are encouraged to print out the blank diagrams and populate them with their own ecosystem elements (collaborators, suppliers, service providers, auditors, certification bodies, regulators etc), and the information infrastructure components of their business systems (web portals, backend ERP, CRM, HR, email systems, subscriptions \u0026 support providers etc). The resulting pictorial representations can be used to establish a common understanding amongst all the stakeholders.\nGovernance Level The governance level ecosystem of a critical sector entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:\nEnterprises and organizations are successful in the long run, only when they have a strong and capable governance mechanism at the top-most level. CSEs, additionally, have to adhere to regulatory, administrative and legal compliances that are mandated for their respective sectors.\nMany small and mid-sized CSEs do not have in-house expertise and competence to design, implement, operate, manage and support a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) program and would depend on external consultancy organisations for the same. Highly regulated sectors like Banking and Financial Services have a well-developed ecosystem of GRC consultancy organisations, certification and audit bodies. Regulators of other critical sectors like Power and Telecom are also developing GRC focused ecosystems for their respective entities. The NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for Consultancy Organisations has two GRC-specific workheads, namely WH-1 and WH-4. The CSEs can use the services of accredited Consultancy Organisations for these Work Heads. The regulators can use the Scheme for development of GRC ecosystems for their respective sectors.\nBusiness Level The business level ecosystem of a critical sector entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:\nEvery CSE performs a set of business and/ or industrial functions to provide services and/ or capabilities to the consumers. The functions, services and capabilities are typically delivered through business and/ or industrial processes. Almost all the business and industrial processes leverage technology, platforms and digital infrastructure for delivery of the functions, services and capabilities.\nThe organisational leadership, business managers and their teams usually work with service provider organisations, who understand their business requirements and can deliver solutions for the same. The solutions are usually implemented using enterprise-grade platforms and custom-developed applications.\nTechnology Level Business applications and sevices run on technology and information infrastructure. The technology level ecosystem of a critical sector entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:\nGenerally, the executive, senior and mid-level managers of entities have a good grasp and understanding of the business complexities and are able to handle them well. However, the complexities of technology and information infrastructure are not well understood by them and it is left to the CIOs, CISOs and their teams to handle the same. In most cases the technical and project teams adopt a technology-driven approach, which leads to misalignment between the business needs and the use of digital ecosystem technologies.\nImportant A key objective of this documentation is to specifically help organisations reduce or eliminate the misalignment between business and technical perspectives.\nMany small and mid-sized CSEs have limted in-house expertise and competence to design, implement, operate, manage, support and secure their IT, OT and IIoT infrastructures. Usually, this work is carried out by their OEMs, System Integrators and other service providers. Thus, these third-party suppliers become an extended workforce of the entities. Automation agents and bots further provide an hugely scalable non-human workforce that can supplement the limited human workforce. However, the CSEs need competent technical personnel within their extended workforce to manage and secure the agents and bots.\nEntities must ensure that their entire composite workforce, comprising of own employees, contracted manpower, and third-party suppliers have the required competence (knowledge, skills and expertise) to do their job functions efficiently and effectively. Entities are encouraged to use the NCIIPC-QCI Schemes for Cybersecurity Professionals, Consultancy Organisations and Training Bodies to assess the competencies and capabilities of their composite workforce. The identified gaps in competencies must be filled up by the concerned HR teams through resources hiring, training and certification.\nCSEs are mandated to adopt the guidelines and directives from national nodal agencies like NCIIPC and CERT-In. They also have well-defined reporting obligations to these agencies. The regulators and national nodal agencies also have an important role related to third-party cybersecurity audits of CSE’s information infrastructure. VAPT and audits carried out by CERT-In empanelled auditors, risk assessments carried out by NCIIPC and special audits carried out under the aegis of the NCSC, together provide vital insights about the cyber resilience of CSEs.\nMany CSEs believe the external VAPT and audits are sufficient by themselves and they do not have to carry out their own internal VTR assessments and audits. This aspect is further analysed in other parts of the documentation.\nPhysical Level The physical level ecosystem of a critical sector entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:\nCSEs are usually required to adhere to specific mandates for physical security, access control and 24x7 monitoring of their critical infrastructure. Typically, in many CSEs, IIoT technologies like digital access control and CCTV systems are used for securing the physical space. However, these systems are not under the ambit of the more competent technical teams under the CIO and CISOs. The top management of CSEs must therefore involve their IT and cybersecurity teams in the design, implementation, operation, protection and monitoring of their physical security systems.\nChapter XI of the draft regulations published by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) gives specific directions to Responsible Entities of the Power sector on the physical security of all identified cyber and non-cyber critical assets.\nMany of the physical processes that OT systems control have the potential to create hazardous situations to human life and safety, property, and the environment. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) is a framework of actions that organisations having OT must take to ensure the protection of the environment without harming the health and safety of their employees or local communities. Manufacturers, implementers, operators, maintainers and regulators of OT systems typically give the highest priority to HSE at the physical level.\nThere are several types of safety systems related to OT environments, which typically use instrumentation systems that operate at the physical level for activities like emergency shut down (ESD), process safety shutdown (PSS), and fire and gas systems (FGS). One of the more well-known types of safety system is the safety instrumented system (SIS).\nNote Bundling of OT safety and IIoT systems under the physical level has its own pros and cons. CSEs should exercise their discretion whether this approach is relevant to the organisation.\nCommon Vocabulary The glossary of terms and definitions provides a common vocabulary that all stakeholders can understand and use. The glossary is divided into the following sub-sections, to align with the ecosystem levels:\nConceptual terms Governance terms Business terms Technology terms Other terms The Conceptual terms provide basic definitions and interpretations for all stakeholders. Notes are added under each term to help the stakeholders apply it correctly to the context in which it is being used.\nThe Governance and Business terms help the business leadership and management to have a common vocabulary while engaging with other stakeholders at these levels.\nThe Technology terms help the technical stakeholders to use a common vocabulary. For example, almost all the interactions at the Technology level between the CSEs, OEMs, service providers and the national nodal agencies are technical in nature. The common vocabulary helps to avoid misunderstanding between the stakeholders.\nNote As an example, the terms “cyber incident”, “cyber security incident” and “cyber security breach” are often used interchangeably. However, the use of these terms must be based on their definitions given in sections 2(g), 2(h) and 2(i) of G.S.R 20(E) - Information Technology (The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team and Manner of Performing Functions and Duties) Rules, 2013.\nOther terms provide some standard definitions for use by all stakeholders.\nThe common vocabulary also provides a very effective way for interactions amongst the stakeholders across the four levels. Technical terms are best used within the Technology level. However, when the outcome of technical analysis has to be conveyed to the stakeholders at the Governance and Business levels, the technical teams must use appropriate terms like business functions, business impact, risk, compliance, protection from harm and so on.",

The content provides a practitioner’s perspective that is also useful to other stakeholders operating in the national cyberspace.\nImportant All rights and credit go directly to their rightful owners. No copyright infringement intended. Wherever applicable, users shall ensure that they possess a rightful copy of the applicable standard(s) and there is no infringement of copyright of the originators/ owners of referred standards.\nThis documentation draws its inspiration from a wide variety of sources, almost all of which have been referenced in footnotes. In some cases, source text has been used directly where it helps the readers to understand the context and use. While substantial editorial effort has been put in to ensure that copyrighted or controlled work is correctly attributed, it is possible that some copyrighted work still needs attribution or additional permissions. Copyright holders are therefore requested to indicate if any material is in conflict with their copyright and the action that should be taken to resolve the same.\nBackground Over the last two decades, India has transformed itself into a highly digitalised nation that has embraced Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) deeply into almost all aspects of our lives. We now have a vibrant national cyberspace, which manifests through a digital ecosystem formed by geographically dispersed, interconnected and federated conglomeration of systems, networks, data repositories, applications, devices, processes and services.\nThe cyberspace is vital to national security, economy, public health, public safety and overall national well-being. The digital ecosystem enables critical sector entities and other organisations to deliver the national critical functions through business and industrial processes that use the digital infrastructure. Hence, it is essential to build, maintain and continually improve the resilience of the digital ecosystem of our critical sectors in a coordinated manner. Any loss of trust in the same has severe consequences for users and other stakeholders of the national cyberspace.\nThe critical sectors in India are listed below:\nBanking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) Telecom Government Power and Energy (P\u0026E) Transport Strategic and Public Enterprises (S\u0026PE) Health Defence Examples of critical functions delivered through the cyberspace in India are listed below:\nBanking, financial markets and insurance payments, transactions, clearing and settlement. Voice and data connectivity and internet services. E-Governance and citizen services. Control, operation and management of utility services like power, fuel, gas etc. Control, operation and management of transportation services like railway/ metro, air traffic, ports etc. Services related to defence, internal security, public safety, and law enforcement. Public health related services. The IT Act 2000 (amended 2008) applies to users and providers of the digital ecosystem, including home users, MSMEs, large enterprises, government \u0026 non-government entities. It was framed to help secure the digital ecosystem while in use by the government, businesses and others for their service delivery, business and organisational functions.\nThe IT Act recognises that the basic responsibility for protecting an entity’s information infrastructure lies with the entity itself. It envisages the possible threats to the digital ecosystem during its use and provides direction and guidance for its protection. Relevant Rules have been framed under the IT Act to enable designated national nodal agencies like NCIIPC and CERT-In to oversee, monitor and respond to cyber attacks from malicious threat actors onto the critical information infrastructure (CII) and the national digital ecosystem. There are other Acts and Rules that mandate sector regulators and other authorities to provide regulatory frameworks to secure the critical sectors and build cyber resilience in critical sector entities under their jurisdiction.\nSecuring the national cyberspace is a collective effort. The public and private entities that own, run, and manage their information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of the same. The intent of the Government is to ensure that adequate checks and balances are implemented, through appropriate legislations, policies and guidelines, for secure and resilient operations of the critical functions and their underlying critical information infrastructure. The intent of national nodal agencies and sectoral regulators is to ensure that cyber risk is appropriately managed in the sectors, to the level demanded by the national interest.\nStructure The site’s documentation section is divided into multiple chapters, sections and topics, covering the perspectives, concerns and needs of different stakeholders within and across critical sector entities and other organisations.\nThe Notes, FAQs, Resources and Glossary sections will be populated over time. A Discussions platform is also set up through GitHub for feedback and community engagement.\nContext Cyber-attacks on critical information infrastructure by organised criminal groups, non-state and state sponsored groups can cause debilitating impact to national security, economy, public health and public safety. The critical sector entities that own, run, and manage their critical information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of their computer resources (systems, networks, applications, data repositories and identities). The entities are expected and required to use appropriate technology, implement various best practices and build a competent workforce to achieve a high level of cyber resilience.\nThe CSEs and other organisations have no dearth of information and guidance from multiple sources to help them secure their IT systems and networks. Yet, a large number of them continue to suffer downtime and losses due to cyber-attacks. An analysis of successful attacks indicate that most of them succeeded because the entities did not or could not apply the cybersecurity information and guidance effectively. A common refrain from cybersecurity experts and auditors is that a large number of entities have negligible or poor implementation of basic and essential cybersecurity controls. It looks as if the entities “do not understand” or “do not want to implement” cybersecurity.\nInteraction with business leaders, managers and the non-IT workforce of entities provides a different perspective. The underlying message from these interactions is that they are unable to integrate cybersecurity into their way of thinking and working – organisational hierarchy, business impact analysis, roles and responsibilities, practices and processes, management systems, reporting structures, RACI etc. Cybersecurity is seen as a technical function that is best carried out by technology experts.\nEvery organisation has a complex mix of internal and external workforce and other stakeholders, each having their own specific roles, functions, backgrounds, competence and limitations. However, everyone understands the concept of business resilience and can therefore grasp the concept of cyber resilience. Hence, it would be appropriate to convert cybersecurity discussions into cyber resilience discussions, to enable the participation of all stakeholders. This calls for\nA common vocabulary that business and technical stakeholders can both use to clearly communicate their respective perspectives, both orally and in writing, without ambiguity and misunderstanding, A shared understanding leads to faster and better convergence of perspectives and improving the decision process at all levels. A cyber resilience framework that harmonises business, IT and cybersecurity perspectives, as also government and regulatory guidelines, directives and global best practices. This site attempts to address the two aspects mentioned above. It provides a common vocabulary through a glossary of terms and definitions that both business and technical users can understand and use. The chapters, sections and topics address different aspects of cyber resilience framework in a harmonised manner, covering institutional structures, people, policies, procedures, practices and processes, technology and collaboration.\nMany of the insights and perspectives are derived from the practices and processes adopted by organisations having a high level of cybersecurity capability and maturity. Organisations should take this documentation as a generic framework that is further adapted for their specific requirements.\nNote Pictorial representations in the documentation are indicative and should be used for triggering discussions on different perspectives.\nAudience Organisations, such as the CSEs, national agencies, regulators, Central Government ministries and State departments, constitute the primary audience for this documentation. They will find this documentation useful for articulating different perspectives, both internally and externally with other stakeholders.\nThe increasing scale and complexity of business and technology is forcing many organisations to depend on competent and knowledgeable service providers, who can enable and support them in the work related to governance, risk, compliance and audit management, design and architecture, systems and security engineering, business and technology processes, and workforce productivity. All such service providers will find this documentation useful for exchanging their perspectives with the primary audience in an unambiguous manner.\nThe primary audience also looks up to Research and Academia to provide them with innovative and future-proof solutions that leverage technology, analytics and AI/ML. The research and academic teams will also find this documentation useful for reaching a common understanding with the primary audience.\nContact For queries, suggestions and feedback, please contact the site administrator at admin@cscin.org.in or the author at kpbhat@cscin.org.in.",

    "content": "Operational Structure Business Units In the modern business and operational context, information technology has become a key business enabler. It is frequently the case that business units, also called line units, generate their own business requirements, consume external IT services, or get systems dedicated to their own units.\nDepartments Departments, also called staff units, perform staff functions to support the entity’s mission. In the context of IT and Information Security, most staff functions are performed through multiple departments with complex interdependencies. Some of the departments involved in a typical CSE for smooth delivery of these functions are:\nAdministration department manages personnel and physical security.\nFinance department manages the procurement.\nWorkforce (HR) department ensures that people have the right competencies and critical positions are always staffed by candidates with the right mix of skills and experience.\nLegal and Corporate Governance department manages legal and regulatory compliance.\nInternal Audit department provides an independent view of compliance of processes and people.\nTechnical functions related to IT are carried out by the IT Department Information Security related functions are carried out by the Information Security Department.\nIt is also well-established that Information technology is a key enabler for non-IT staff functions. The functional requirements of various departments are typically enabled through IT. The IT department is usually responsible for the design, development and/ or procurement, implementation and deployment, operation and management of the IT infrastructure, operations, and support. The departments themselves focus on the usage side of IT, covering the users, applications, and data.\nFurther, the Information Security Department usually works closely with the IT and the Legal and Corporate Governance Departments as part of its responsibility and accountability towards the governance, risk, policies, compliance, and assessment of information security of the entity’s IT infrastructure.\nSites and Locations Large enterprises are typically spread across multiple sites or geographical locations, typically referred to as remote or branch offices. Sectors such as Power and Energy have OT Sites in the form of substations and regional command and control centres. Enterprises with such geographically separated ICTs must ensure governance mechanisms and controls for the holistic cybersecurity of the entity.\nOrganisational Structure Board of Directors The Board of Directors of CSEs is ultimately accountable for cybersecurity in the organisation and its responsibilities would include:\napproving strategic goals, business objectives, and policies related to IT, Business Continuity, Information Security, Cyber Security, and Cyber Crisis Management, approving the cyber risk appetite as part of the overall risk appetite,\napproving and overseeing the cybersecurity programme, strategy, and policy to manage cyber risks,\nensuring the implementation of the cybersecurity program,\nbeing aware of and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory obligations related to cyber security risks,\nsupporting the culture of awareness of cybersecurity in the organisation,\nallocating adequate budget and resources for fulfilling cybersecurity requirements.\nThe Board of Directors of the CSEs should set up appropriate board level and other high-level empowered committees for the purpose of Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security to support both strategic and operational goals while addressing the unique risk and compliance requirements in these areas. The governance structures should be kept in mind while framing these committees. Board should have independent director with substantial IT expertise in managing / guiding information technology initiatives. Further technically competent members should be there in the Committees formed. In case, any CSE doesn’t have a Board of Directors, then it would be the responsibility of the top management or executive leadership to set up appropriate high-level empowered committees for the purpose of Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security and ensure their effective functioning.\nCSEs having “Protected System” are mandated to constitute an Information Security Steering Committee (ISSC) under the Chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer/ Managing Director/ Secretary of the organisation as per the Information Technology (Information Security Practices and Procedures for Protected System) Rules, 2018 notified vide Gazette Notification S.O. 2235(E) dated 22 May 2018. Top-Level Management The top management of entities, led by the Chief Executive (Managing Director or CEO) is accountable to the governing body (or Board) with respect to the effective and efficient use of Information, Communication and Operational Technologies and Information Security. Most entities usually have permanent leadership roles, with teams under them, that constitutes enterprise-level top management. Typical leadership roles in a CSE are Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Chief of Operations/ Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) and, if required by law, a Data Protection Officer (DPO).\nTop-level management’s responsibilities in CSEs will centre around strategic alignment, value delivery, risk management, resource optimization, and stakeholder engagement to leverage IT for competitive advantage and sustainable business performance.\nThe essential top-level management functions for Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) and Information Security Governance (EISG) are:\nAligning IT and infosec goals and objectives with the overall business strategy and vision set by the Board of Directors. This involves\nsetting objectives and initiatives in line with the overall business goals.\nestablishing governance structures by creating committees and steering groups to oversee the alignment between business, IT and cyber resilience.\nestablishing entity-wide policies and programs.\nensuring stakeholder involvement.\nProviding leadership, direction and oversight for the IT and Infosec departments. This includes defining the IT operating models, planning, organising and implementing projects to achieve the desired business outcomes, budgeting, organisational structure, roles and responsibilities, and project management oversight.\nResource Management - This entails ensuring optimal allocation and utilization of IT and infosec resources (e.g., personnel, technology, budgets), capacity planning, developing strategies for internal and external sourcing of IT and infosec services and solutions, exercising oversight on contracts with third-party service providers, outsourcing of work to Managed Service Providers (MSP), etc. Adequate resources should be designated specifically for cybersecurity, separate from those allocated for general IT needs. Allocation of such resources may widely vary based on the business objective and risk management of each CSE. However, based on global best practice, it is recommended that at least 10% of the total IT budget should be allocated to cybersecurity. This should progressively increase as per the cybersecurity risks faced by the entity. Such allocation should be mentioned under a separate budget head for monitoring by the Board of Directors, Governing Body\nRisk Management - This involves\nestablishing a risk management framework that identifies, assesses and mitigates risks associated with the use of technology, and ensures compliance with the relevant laws, regulations, and policies.\nanalysing and managing the business impact of degradation, failure and non-availability of IT, OT and IIoT systems, and safety of operational technologies (OT).\nMonitoring and measuring IT performance and value delivery - This involves\nmaintaining oversight using management systems for all IT, OT and Information Security aspects that can adversely affect the organisation.\nestablishing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) for IT and infosec services and activities.\nusing performance data to drive continuous improvement in services and processes.\nbenchmarking to compare IT and infosec performance against industry standards and best practices.\nFostering effective communication, collaboration and partnership between business and IT stakeholders. Communicate regularly within and outside the entity to ensure coherence. This is especially important during crisis management related to high-impact IT and cybersecurity incidents.\nThe Enterprise Information Security Governance (EISG) functions are usually led by the CRO or the Enterprise CISO, who is responsible for the implementation of enterprise-wide information security policies, and exercising information security-related oversight on the business groups and business units of the enterprise.\nA CISO should have knowledge and experience of information security governance, risk and compliance management, ISMS and related issues. The CISO’s responsibilities typically includes cyber resilience and cybersecurity planning, development and rollout of ISMS, coordinating the cyber security related issues within the organisation and with relevant external agencies. The CISO must be capable of performing the duties as per “Roles and Responsibilities of CISOs” as defined by NCIIPC, CERT-In and Regulators.\nCSEs must clearly define the roles, responsibilties and teams for governance of enterprise IT and information security, as appropriate to their organisational structures. The leadership and teams must be given the required authority and resources to carry out their functions and held accountable for the required outcomes. A key factor for success is the ability of the leaders, their teams, business units and departments to work collaboratively to address the shared concerns of all stakeholders. Adequate thought must be given to behavioural aspects and conflict resolution mechanisms while assigning responsibilities to leaders and teams. Further, each team must have a proper mix of expertise and experience and should use technology to carry out the functions effectively.\nCommittees Entities usually have different formal and semi-formal structures to support the governing body and the top management in their IT and information security governance functions. These structures are in the form of committees, groups, task forces etc, and typically carry out evaluation, monitoring, and oversight functions to support the governing body and the top management.\nMany Sectoral Regulators have prescribed the frameworks for the Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security for their regulated entities. The governance frameworks and governance related guidance of the important regulators of the country emphasise the need to have a good governance framework for enterprise IT and Information Security of entities using ICT for achieving their business mission and objectives.\nInformation Security Division/ Department (ISD) The ISD of an entity is responsible for planning, implementing and continually improving the technology-driven capabilities, processes, and workforce to achieve cybersecurity.\nEach business group or unit in the CSE may have its own ISO (Information Security Officer) and a team under him who may hierarchically report to the CISO. Together, they constitute the entity’s Information Security Division/ Department with appropriate resources and manpower based on the size and business of the CSE.\nTechnology Strategy and Perspective Planning All modern enterprises use technology to carry out their business functions. A good practice followed by many organisations is to have a Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning (TS\u0026PP) programme for planning, implementing and continually improving the technology-driven capabilities, processes, and workforce.\nThe technologies and processes are typically deployed through individual projects that are conceived, designed, and implemented by different business units and departments. In many cases, this leads to duplication or inadequate optimisation of enterprise resources, operations, and workforce utilisation.\nThe use of IT, OT and Information Security should therefore be evaluated, directed, and monitored from an entity-wide perspective that enables the governing bodies and top management to holistically evaluate the achievement of mission and business objectives. This will ensure that the individual IT, OT and IS projects of different business units and departments are aligned with the enterprise’s strategic IT and Information Security objectives and compliant with all enterprise policies and processes. Further, it helps in the optimisation of investments, IT and cybersecurity workforce competency development, exploitation of the latest technologies and practices, continuous improvement of cybersecurity maturity etc. Organisations will benefit from having an entity-wide TS\u0026PP programme that provides enterprise-wide strategic direction and decisions on the use of IT, OT, and information security. The CTO, CIO, Heads of OT and CISO should be a part of Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning committee. Typically the committee should\nevaluate the objectives and expected outcomes of different projects within the overall technology adoption roadmap of the organisation.\nsynergise activities and investments across multiple projects.\nprovide oversight and guidance to individual project management teams.\noversee the cyber resilience aspects.\nPerformance and Effectiveness Monitoring Governing bodies and top management should have a well-defined mechanism for monitoring and measurement of IT, OT and Information Security performance and effectiveness of management systems and processes at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. The monitoring and measurement mechanism should cover all processes, both automated and manual, with the objective of providing actionable evidence to take preventive and corrective actions at each level.\nMetrics are tools designed to enhance the performance and accountability through collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant performance related data. Metrics in information security track the achievement of set goals and objectives by measuring the degree to which security measures are applied, as well as assessing the controls’ efficiency and efficacy, evaluating the sufficiency of security measures, and pinpointing potential areas for improvement. Entities should develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for evaluation of their IT and Information Security programmes and periodically evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of their IT and Information Security Governance programmes by measuring the defined KPIs.\nOrganizations will benefit significantly from having a Performance and Effectiveness Monitoring (P\u0026EM) programme to assist the governing bodies and top management in their function of enterprise-wide monitoring and measurement of IT, OT and infosec performance and effectiveness. The Governance, Risk and Compliance team should work with the business units, IT, OT and Infosec Heads and other stakeholders to develop KPIs that monitor and measure vital aspects of IT, OT and Information Security processes, people and technologies. The KPIs should address the concerns of the governing body and top management.\nCSEs should put in place a structured process of reporting cybersecurity related matters to the Board or the Board Level Committees through the CISO. Structured reporting should inter alia include, key cyber risks faced by the organisation, cyber security preparedness, cyber security postures, organisational initiatives to enhance the cyber security resilience, status of compliance with regulatory guidelines, reporting of cyber security events and incidents.",

    "content": "The terms and definitions are for all stakeholders to use for communicating their perspectives to achieve a common understanding. The terms and definitions are derived from various authoritative sources, accepted standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE, NIST etc), applicable laws (e.g. The IT Act 2000), regulations and broadly accepted public terminologies. The source(s) of definitions of the terms are also provided, where available. The notes added under the terms provide additional context for readers.\nTip Refer here on how to use the glossary. The Search function can also be used for searching through the glossary using appropriate keywords.\nConceptual Terms Digital ecosystem a geographically dispersed, interconnected and federated conglomeration of systems, networks, data repositories, applications, devices, processes and services. Note 1: The digital ecosystem is also termed as the digital or information infrastructure.\nCyberspace a conceptual term that mimics the physical space but in a virtual domain. It manifests itself in the form of a digital ecosystem across the world. Note 1: The national cyberspace is a subset of the global cyberspace, used by the nation’s organisations and people for their business and personal functions. The national cyberspace is not defined by who owns it but by who uses it.\nNote 2: An Indian organisation’s cyberspace is a subset within the national cyberspace, used by the organisation for its business functions. The organisation acquires the digital infrastructure and uses it to deploy and run applications that enable and support the organisation’s business/ operations. The organisation federates its digital infrastructure with other organisations within the national and global cyberspace.\nNote 3: An organisation’s own cyberspace and the national cyberspace can be demarcated within the global cyberspace by means of domains, zones and segments.\nCritical Information Infrastructure (ITAA-2008) the computer resource, the incapacitation or destruction of which, shall have debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health or safety. Critical sectors (G.S.R. 19(E), 16 Jan 2014) sectors, which are critical to the nation and whose incapacitation or destruction will have a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health, or safety. Information Technology (IT) (NIST) any services, equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that are used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) (NIST) all categories of ubiquitous technology used for the gathering, storing, transmitting, retrieving, or processing of information (e.g., microelectronics, printed circuit boards, computing systems, software, signal processors, mobile telephony, satellite communications, and networks). Operations Technology (OT) (NIST) a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment or manage devices that interact with the physical environment. These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Note 1: Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems.\nNote 2: Alternative terms for OT are Industrial Control Systems (ICS) (used by NIST) and Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) (used by IEC).\nInternet of Things (IoT) (NIST) user or industrial devices that are connected to the internet. IoT devices include sensors, controllers, and household appliances. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) (NIST) sensors, instruments, machines, and other devices that are networked together and use Internet connectivity to enhance industrial and manufacturing business processes and applications. Note 1: An IoT device has at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world and at least one wired or wireless network interface (e.g., ethernet, wi-fi, bluetooth, Long-Term Evolution (LTE), Zigbee, Ultra-Wideband (UWB)) for interfacing with the digital world (NIST IR 8259).\nNote 2: An IoT product contains at least one IoT device and three specific kinds of IoT product components (NIST IR 8425):\nSpecialty networking/ gateway hardware.\nCompanion application software.\nBackends to which data is transferred for backup, storage and analysis.\nNote 3: An IoT system is composed of networked IoT components and interacts with a physical entity of interest through one or more sensors and/or actuators that are within the IoT components. IoT systems differ from conventional IT systems in their ability to directly interact with the physical world (NIST IR 8316).\nSystem (ISO 15288:2015) combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes. Note 1: A system is sometimes considered as a product or as the services it provides.\nNote 2: In practice, the interpretation of its meaning is frequently clarified by the use of an associative noun, e.g. aircraft system. Alternatively, the word “system” is substituted simply by a context-dependent synonym, e.g. aircraft, though this potentially obscures a system principles perspective.\nNote 3: A complete system includes all of the associated equipment, facilities, material, computer programs, firmware, technical documentation, services and personnel required for operations and support to the degree necessary for self-sufficient use in its intended environment.\nNote 4: Stakeholders, while expressing their perspectives, are encouraged to clarify the context of the term ‘System’. For example, in governance and business level interactions, ‘System’ will typically represent the business function or process that is provided (Note 1 above). In technology level interactions, ‘System’ will typically represent the technology and support elements (Note 3 above).\nSystem-of-interest (ISO 15288:2015) system whose life cycle is under consideration. System-of-systems (SoS) (ISO 15288:2015) set of systems that integrate or interoperate to provide a unique capability that none of the constituent systems can accomplish on its own. Note 1: Each constituent system is a useful system by itself, having its own management, goals, and resources, but coordinates within the SoS to provide the unique capability of the SoS.\nInformation security (IS) (NIST) the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Information security (IS) (ISO 27000:2018) preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Note: In addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.\nCyber security (CS) (ITAA-2008) protecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Note 1: The definition is explicitly used for information technology (IT) elements and also for elements of operations technology (OT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).\nNote 2: The terms Information Security (IS) and Cyber Security (CS) are often used interchangeably, since there are only some minor distinctions between the two terms. Notes 3 to 6 below provide guidance for specific situations in which one term is more appropriate than the other.\nNote 3: In general, the information security is used in the context of securing information that is held and managed in both digital and non-digital (paper-based) forms. Cybersecurity is used in the context of securing the cyber-ecosystem (IT, OT, and IIoT) from cyber-attacks.\nNote 4: Data and information content encompasses i) content created, used and managed using office productivity tools, ii) content stored in databases and other electronic repositories, which may be located on-premises or on cloud, iii) content searched, accessed and shared using web, email and other technologies, iv) machine to machine exchange of content through information exchange standards and protocols (EDI, API, STIX/TAXII), and OT-specific communication protocols (Modbus, DNP3/ IEEE 1815-2012, IEC-60870, IEC 61850, IEC 61131, IEC 62351) and, v) archival content stored in online and offline backups.\nNote 5: Data and information related activities encompass i) content creation, updation and deletion (CRUD activities), ii) data processing, iii) view, copy, scan, search and print, iv) content integrity and confidentiality protection using digital signatures and encryption, v) masking or redaction of sensitive content and reclassification of the masked/ redacted content, vi) content exchange and distribution through electronic media and communication channels, vii) short-term and long-term storage of content and, viii) secure disposal of content from all the electronic stores, as per the organisation policies.\nNote 6: Most OT systems are process control systems. Typically, the input and output OT data of such systems have a short period of utility. The most important concerns of such systems are the availability of the systems themselves, safety of the physical environment around the systems or influenced by them. The confidentiality of data exchanged through OT protocols, as well as intermittent data loss are minor concerns. As regards data integrity, the concern is more about the integrity of the process control systems that generate, consume and process the data using OT protocols. In summary, focus of OT security is more about protecting critical processes (Safety, Availability, Integrity) and less about data loss (Confidentiality).\nCyber defence a set of defensive activities carried out across the organisation’s digital infrastructure by different teams of the organisation, by means of well-established practices and processes, with or without automation. Note 1: The objective of cyber defence is to prevent the organisation’s digital infrastructure from being harmed and to ensure its availability for use by all authorised users.\nNote 2: Cyber defence is similar to physical defence but in the cyberspace. Just as in physical defence, securing the digital infrastructure of the nation and/ or organisations requires both proactive actions like anticipating, continually observing and plugging breaches, and reactive measures like responding to and mitigating cyberattacks when they occur.\nResilience (NIST) the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruption. Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents. Cyber resilience (NIST) the ability of an information system to operate under adverse conditions or stress, even if in a degraded or debilitated state, while maintaining essential operational capabilities, and to recover to an effective operational posture in a time frame consistent with mission needs.\nthe ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.\nNote: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting the digital infrastructure from unauthorised access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. Cyber resilience is an organisation’s capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber threats and disruptions. Both functions require a combination of technologies, practices and processes, policies and controls, peope and governance for delivering the required outcomes.\nDomain (ISO/IEC/IEEE) distinct scope, within which common characteristics are exhibited, common rules observed, and over which a distribution transparency is preserved.\narea of knowledge or activity characterized by a set of concepts and terminology understood by practitioners in that area.\nDomain (NIST) a set of elements, data, resources, and functions that share a commonality in combinations of (1) roles supported, (2) rules governing their use, and (3) protection needs. Note 1: Domain Coverage/ Scope - A domain’s coverage/ scope lists the elements, data, resources, processes and practices grouped under the domain, to reflect one or any combination of the following: i) capability, functional, or service distinctions; ii) data flow and control flow associated with capability, functional, or service distinctions; iii) data and information sensitivity; iv) data and information security; or v) administrative, management, operational, or jurisdictional authority.\nNote 2: Domain Principle/ Objective - A domain’s principle/ objective describes at a high level what an organisation is required to do/ achieve with regard to the requirements for the domain, using the triad of processes, people and technology.\nNote 3: “Domain” is a widely used term by different practitioners to describe their working environments. For example, management teams use the term to describe distinct functional areas and job responsibilities. Systems and software engineering teams classify their work into different technical domains. HR and training teams define knowledge and skill domains to refer to different sets of concepts, topics and modules about which the professionals are expected to possess or develop the required competency. Security teams define security domains to categorise the security characteristics, policies and authorities. Cybersecurity capability maturity modelling research teams use distinct domains to classify, gather evidence and measure the capability and maturity of organisations.\nPolicy (ISO 38500:2015) intentions and direction of an organisation as formally expressed by its governing body or executive managers acting with appropriate authority. Note 1: A “policy” is a high-level statement of intent or direction that provides guidance to individuals and organisations on how they should act in specific circumstances. A policy is a formal declaration of an organisation’s objectives, values, and principles, and it provides the basis for decision-making and the development of related processes, procedures, and controls.\nNote 2: Policies are an important component of a management system, as they provide the overall direction and guidance for the management system and help to ensure that the management system is aligned with the organisation’s objectives and values. Policies should be clear, concise, and aligned with the overall strategic objectives of the organisation, to enable the management system to deliver its intended outcomes.\nNote 3: A policy typically defines a scope (business processes, departments and locations that will be covered by the policy), the external and internal environment of the organisation (to identify the interfaces and dependencies), and the business, IT, and information security objectives of the policy (what it seeks to achieve).\nPractice a set of activities that are continuously carried out over time, in pursuit of an organisation’s strategic interests and goals. Note 1: A “practice” typically comprises of persons/ teams owning the practice, along with activities, governance, tools, and technology platforms to implement and operate the practice. The intelligence of the practice—how it gets something accomplished—is embedded in the complex, analytical and decision-making expertise of the practice owners (individuals/ teams). The key outcomes of a practice are continuous refinement, optimisation of effort and leveraging of the organisation’s expertise. The adoption of best practices can help organisations to improve their performance, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve their goals more effectively.\nProcess set of interrelated or interacting activities that use inputs to deliver an intended result. (ISO 9000:2015)\na set of repeatable activities and tasks, usually designed as a set of well-defined steps with well-defined beginnings and ends, to get something done.\nNote 1: A “process” typically comprises of people, activities and tasks, governance, tools, and technology platforms to implement and execute the process. The execution steps of a process may be carried out sequentially or in parallel, either by a person, team or through automation. The intelligence of the process—how it gets something accomplished—is embedded in the process design and does not require complex decision-making by the persons or automation agents executing the steps. In other words, the process designer converts the knowledge of an activity or task into well-defined sequence of steps and records the same in the process documentation. People or automation agents are only supposed to know how to execute the steps laid down in the process documentation, without having to understand why they are to be done. The key outcomes of a process are standardisation, speed, efficiency and automation.\nNote 2: There is no rigid hierarchy between practices and processes. A practice can have multiple sub-practices and/ or processes. Usually, over time, many practice owners convert parts of their practice into processes with well-defined execution steps and enable them using automation.\nNote 3: Everything need not be a practice or a process. For example, activities and tasks that are performed infrequently, or those that do not have clear sequence of steps, can just be accomplished without defining a practice or process for the same. It is also important that practices and processes should not become the end goal by themselves but should only help reach the end goal.\nNote 4: Parameters and metrics to quantify and measure a practice or process are designed so as to help improve and maintain their performance and effectiveness.\nProcedure specified way to carry out an activity or a process, which may or may not be documented. (ISO 9000:2015)\na specific and documented way of performing a task or activity, to ensure that it is carried out consistently in its defined manner.\nNote 1: A procedure typically outlines the detailed steps to be followed by an individual, a team or automation to perform a task or activity to achieve the required outcomes of the task or activity. Procedures are more prescriptive and granular than processes.\nGuidelines a type of document that provides recommendations or suggestions on how to achieve a particular outcome or meet certain objectives. Note 1: Guidelines are intended to help users interpret and apply the requirements and principles set out in the applicable policies and standards, and to provide guidance and best practices for specific applications or contexts.\nControl a mechanism to ensure that an activity or process is performed as intended. It comprises of a set of actions that should be taken to manage risk, prevent or mitigate negative outcomes, and ensure that the system is functioning as required. Note 1: In the context of cybersecurity, a control is a measure implemented to reduce risk and protect information assets. The specific risk or issue being addressed defines the type of control(s) to be used, which may be administrative controls, such as policies and procedures, technical controls, such as role-based access permissions or physical controls, such as locks and alarms.\nControl objective/ purpose a statement that defines what a control is intended to achieve. Note 1: A control objective is a specific and measurable outcome that is desired from a control. It provides the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the control in relation to the risks or issues that the management system is designed to address.\nNote 2: Control objectives/ purposes are an important component of a management system, as they provide the basis for defining and designing controls. Effective control objectives help organisations ensure that their management system is functioning effectively and achieving their objectives.\nGovernance Terms Accountable (ISO 38500:2015) answerable for actions, decisions and performance. Accountability state of being accountable. Accountability relates to an allocated responsibility. The responsibility can be based on regulation or agreement or through assignment as part of delegation. (ISO 38500:2015)\nthe obligation to exercise authority that is based on established standards and to take ownership of the outcomes or results.\nNote 1: Authority can be delegated, Responsibility can be shared but cannot be delegated, Accountability can neither be shared nor delegated.\nAim or Goal the desired result of an effort. Note: In an entity/ organisational context, the term ‘mission’ is also used.\nAudit a structured, independent, and recorded method for gathering audit evidence and impartially assessing it to ascertain the degree of compliance with the audit standards. Note 1: Audits can be internal (first party), external (second-party or third-party), or combined audits (integrating multiple disciplines).\nNote 2: An internal audit is carried out by the organization or by an external entity acting for the organization.\nNote 3: The fundamental elements of an audit include the determination of the conformity of an object according to a procedure carried out by personnel not being responsible for the object audited.\nNote 4: An internal audit may serve management review and other in-house functions and may underpin an organization’s self-declaration of compliance. Independence in this context is demonstrated by the auditor’s lack of involvement in the activities under review. External audits encompass both second and third-party evaluations. Second-party audits are performed by parties with a vested interest in the organization, like clients or their representatives. Third-party audits are carried out by independent external bodies, such as certification authorities or regulatory agencies.\nNote 5: This constitutes one of the common terms and core definitions of the high-level structure for ISO management system standards. The original definition has been modified by adding Notes 3 and 4 to entry.\nAuthority the right or power assigned to an individual or a government entity in order to achieve defined goals and objectives. An ‘authority’ gives official and legal right to take decisions, command action by others and enforce compliance. Board of Directors usually maps to the governing body. Designations are usually in the form of CMD, MD, Executive and Non-executive Directors. In the Government, the word ‘Authority’ is also used. Context of the organisation (ISO 9000:2015) Combination of internal and external issues that can have an effect on an organisation’s approach to developing and achieving its objectives. Consequence (NIST, ISO 15026-1:2019) effect (change or non-change), usually associated with an event or condition or with the system and usually allowed, facilitated, caused, prevented, changed, or contributed to by the event, condition, or system. Continuity the strategic and tactical ability, sanctioned by management, for an organization to prepare for and react to various conditions, situations, and events to maintain operations at an approved, predetermined level. Note 1: Continuity is a broader concept that encompasses both operational and business continuity, ensuring an organization’s capacity to continue functioning under non-standard conditions. This concept is applicable to all types of organizations, including for-profit, non-profit, public interest, and governmental entities.\nCoordination way in which different organisations (public or private) or parts of the same organisation work or act together in order to achieve a common objective. Note 1: Coordination combines the individual response efforts of all involved entities to create a cohesive incident response with a shared goal and coordinates actions through open sharing of information about their respective incident response efforts.\nNote 2: All organizations participate in the process to agree on a shared incident response goal and commit to implementing strategies through a consensus-based decision-making process.\nCorrective action to prevent recurrence, remove the cause of a nonconformity and prevent it from occurring. Crisis volatile situation marked by an imminent drastic or substantial change that demands immediate attention and action to safeguard lives, assets, property, or the environment. Crisis management comprehensive management approach that identifies potential threats to an organization and establishes a structure for resilience, with the capacity for an effective response that protects the interests of the organization’s key stakeholders, reputation, brand, and value-generating activities, as well as efficiently reinstating operational capabilities. Note 1: Crisis management also involves managing readiness, mitigation, response, and recovery or continuity in the event of an incident, as well as overseeing the overall programme through training, rehearsals, and reviews to ensure that preparedness, response, and continuity plans remain current and relevant.\nCrisis management team a collective of individuals tasked with guiding the creation and implementation of plans for response and operational continuity, declaring states of operational disruption or crisis, and directing the recovery efforts both before and after an incident. Note 1: This team may include members from within the organization as well as first responders and other relevant parties.\nCriticality analysis a systematic procedure to identify and assess the significance of an organization’s assets based on their role in the organization’s mission, the potential impact on people, or the consequences of disruptions on meeting organizational goals. Customer (ISO 20000-10:2018) organisation or part of an organisation that receives a service or services. EXAMPLE: Consumer, client, beneficiary, sponsor, purchaser.\nNote 1: A customer can be internal or external to the organisation delivering the service or services.\nNote 2: A customer can also be a user. A customer can also act as a supplier.\nDirect (ISO 38500:2015) communicate desired purposes and outcomes to. In the context of governance of IT, ‘direct’ involves setting objectives, strategies, and policies to be adopted by the members of the organisation to ensure that use of IT meets business objectives. Objectives, strategies, and policies can be set by managers if they have authority delegated by the governing body. Disruption an event, expected or unexpected, that causes an undesired deviation from the anticipated delivery of products and services, impacting an organization’s objectives. Documented information records that an organization must manage and maintain, which can be in various formats and media, originating from any source. EXAMPLE: Policies, plans, process descriptions, procedures, service level agreements or contracts.\nNote 1: Documented information can encompass the management system, its processes, operational documentation, and evidence of outcomes achieved.\nEffectiveness (ISO 9000:2015, ISO 20000-10:2018) extent to which planned activities are realized and planned results are achieved. Efficiency (ISO 9000:2015) relationship between the result achieved and the resources used. Enterprise (TOGAF) any collection of Organizations that has a common set of goals. Example: an enterprise could be a government agency, a whole corporation, a division of a corporation, a single department, or a chain of geographically distant Organizations linked together by common ownership. An extended enterprise nowadays frequently includes partners, suppliers, and customers.\nEnterprise or corporate governance The functions carried out by the governing body of an entity and the top management of the Organisations of an entity. Entity (ISO 27014:2020) a corporate or enterprise group of companies or a single company in the public or private sector, a government body or a body owned or controlled by the government. An entity can have multiple Organizations within itself or be identical to the organisation, as in smaller companies. The entity has governance authority over the organisation. Evaluate (ISO 38500:2015) consider and make informed judgements. In the context of governance of IT, evaluate involves judgements about the internal and external, current and future circumstances and opportunities relating to the organisation’s current and future use of IT. Executive manager (ISO 38500:2015) person who has authority delegated from the governing body for implementation of strategies and policies to fulfil the purpose of the organisation. Executive managers can include roles which report to the governing body or the head of the organisation or have overall accountability for major reporting function, for example Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), Heads of Government Organizations, Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), Chief Operating Officers (COOs), Chief Information Officers (CIs), and similar roles. In management standards, executive managers can be referred to as top management. Executive management usually maps to the top management of the entity and its Organisations. Designations are usually in the form of CXOs. External supplier (ISO 20000-10:2018) another party that is external to the organisation that enters into a contract to contribute to the planning, design, transition, delivery or improvement of a service, service component or process. Function, Operation what an entity does in order to fulfil its goal, mission and objectives. Typically comprises of activities, processes, practices. Governance (ISO 38500:2015) system of directing and controlling Governance of information security system by which an organisation’s information security activities are directed and controlled. (ISO 27000:2018)\nthe means by which an organisation’s governing body provides overall direction and control of activities that affect the security of an organisation’s information. This direction and control focuses on circumstances where inadequate information security can adversely affect the organisation’s ability to achieve its overall objectives. (ISO/IEC 27014:2020, Reccomendation ITU-T X.1054 (04/2021))\nIt is common for a governing body to realise its governance objectives by:\nproviding direction by setting strategies and policies; monitoring the performance of the organization; and evaluating proposals and plans developed by managers. Management of information security is associated with ensuring the achievement of the objectives of the organisation described within the strategies and policies established by the governing body. This can include interacting with the governing body by:\nproviding proposals and plans for consideration by the governing body; and providing information to the governing body concerning the performance of the organization. Effective governance of information security requires both members of the governing body and managers to fulfil their respective roles in a consistent way.\nGovernance of IT (ISO 38500:2015) system by which the current and future use of IT is directed and controlled.

    "content": "The capability framework for the nation’s digital ecosystem describes the people, processes and technology related capabilities in a manner that is agnostic of specific products and solutions. It enunciates the IT and information security capabilities that the digital ecosystem participants should acquire, maintain, and continually improve so as to achieve their objective of cyber resilience. It also describes how organisations can ensure the effective use and sustenance of IT and information security capabilities through a lifecycle approach.\nThe target audience for the capability framework includes:\nBusiness and GRC Heads, CIOs, Heads of OT, CISOs and their respective teams within CSEs.\nSectoral Regulators, who are mandated to oversee and ensure the cyber resilience of business and IT practices in their regulated entities.\nConsultancy Organisations, System Integrators, OEMs, MSPs and MSSPs engaged by the CSEs.\nEmpanelled bodies, who carry out cyber security verification \u0026 validation (V\u0026V), VAPT and technical audit of systems and networks of CSEs.\nGoverning bodies and top management of entities (through the Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning Group, the IT, OT and Information Security Divisions) can use this guidance to use, secure and sustain their IT for delivery of business functions, operations, and services.\nSmart, Resilient and Sustainable Digital Ecosystem In the current information age, data and communication technologies along with smart devices are deeply integrated into almost all aspects of our lives. The nation today runs on well-orchestrated and integrated IT and is therefore critically dependent upon the cyberspace and its underlying infrastructure (systems, networks, applications and data). Hence, it is vital that the Indian cyberspace is secure and protected against cyber-attacks that could jeopardise the benefits it offers to national security, economic prosperity, governance, constitutional processes, and social well-being.\nThe integration of IT at the sectoral, regional, and national levels will only increase in future. Hence, at the national level, there is need to develop capabilities for a smart, resilient, and sustainable federated digital ecosystem. These terms are described below.\nSmart: describes the high levels of automation, analytics and decision support capabilities that are enabled by the use of IT. In the context of information and cyber security, these capabilities are typically achieved by the use of intelligent devices, analytics, AI and machine learning for preventing, protecting, detecting and responding to cyber-attacks on IT and OT. Smart technologies can significantly improve the functioning, performance and resilience of the digital ecosystem.\nResilient: ‘Resilient’ describes the ability of the business and IT ecosystems to not only withstand large scale attacks and mitigate its destructive power but also the capability to recover from a successful attack in the shortest possible time with minimal damage or disruption. It is a key component of business and organisational needs and achieved through well-designed operating procedures, processes, and practices.\nSustainable: ‘Sustainable’ describes the ability of the critical sector entities and the nation as a whole to be able to use and sustain IT for delivery of national critical functions and business services efficiently and effectively over a long period of time that extends into decades. It can be achieved through a combination of institutional structures, people, policies, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) mechanisms.\nTerms The following terms establish a common vocabulary for communication of capabilities, objectives, activities and outcomes. They may be used within the organisations, from the executive level to the operations level, and with external stakeholders for business and technology level communication.\nInformation Technology (IT) capability is described as an organisation’s ability to identify IT business needs, to deploy IT to improve business process in a cost-effective manner, and to provide long-term maintenance and support for IT-based systems.\nInformation Security (IS) capability is defined as “an organisation’s ability to carry out a set of inter-related cybersecurity functions to secure, protect, defend and sustain its mission and business functions that run on underlying IT and OT infrastructure in the cyberspace”.\nCyber resilience is a key outcome expected from a full-fledged capability development program. A smart, resilient, and sustainable federated digital ecosystem is achieved at the national level only when all the stakeholders achieve a minimum level of cyber resilience through their individual capability development initiatives.\nFunctions represent sets of management and technical activities that organisations must carry out daily or periodically to achieve their cyber resilience objectives. The objectives are described using action-verbs defined below. Organisations can implement the functions through institutionalised practices and processes that must be carried out by the workforce, enabled by technology and tools.\nManagement Objectives and Activities The action verbs describing the five management objectives are Govern \u0026 Administer, Acquire \u0026 Provision, Operate \u0026 Maintain, Analyse \u0026 Investigate, and Train \u0026 Enable. Activities to achieve the management objectives are usually owned, managed and carried out by different units and departments across the organisation.\nTechnical Objectives and Activities The action verbs describing the five technical objectives are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. Activities to achieve the technical objectives are usually owned, managed and carried out by the IT, OT, IIoT and IS workforce of the organisation.\nThe technical objectives are derived from NIST CSF, and the guidelines issued by multiple regulators and national agencies. There are minor variations in the definitions of the action-verbs by these different bodies, which can lead to confusion and misunderstanding in conversations between the practitioners of different guidelines. Hence, it is suggested that the definitions given in this document be used as the base for generic discussions.\nDescription of Functions A diagrammatic representation of the technical and management functions is given below.\nThe individual functions are further described below.\nNote The scope of each function in this document is kept short and focused, specifically to help the non-technical users from being overwhelmed.\nIdentify This technical function addresses the need for organisations to identify things of value that need to be secured and protected from harm. The key practices and processes under this function are:\nAsset lifecycle management: Identify and catalogue all physical and software assets, both in-store and in-use, across their asset lifecycle from purchase till decommissioning.\nInformation and data lifecycle management: Identify and catalogue all organisational information and data, along with parameters that help define their sensitivity, organisational value, ownership, restrictions etc, across the information and data lifecycle from creation till disposal.\nIdentity lifecycle management: Identify all individuals, systems, and applications along with their roles, privileges, credentials, and access rights (to assets, information, and data) across their active lifecycle from onboarding till retirement.\nThe Identify function is a continuously running activity and needs regular review and update. The data managed through this activity is used by all other functions and is therefore a fundamental pillar of the framework. Automation of data collation and analysis activities under this function would be extremely useful to organisations, depending upon their size, budget, and risk profile.\nProtect This technical function addresses the need for organisations to establish and maintain robust defences by continuously searching for, discovering and acting upon vulnerabilties and weaknesses. A robust defensive action minimises the vulnerabilities and weaknesses and reduces the possibility of their exploitation by threat actors. The key processes under this function are:\nProtection of in-store and in-use assets spanning across geographies of the organisation’s operational structure. This is typically achieved through hardening of in-use systems, networks, applications, databases, and other components of the information infrastructure, including IoT and IIoT.\nProtection of data (at rest, in transit, in use) to achieve confidentiality, integrity and availability.\nProtection of identities of people, machines and devices.\nProtection of physical premises and safety of OT and IIoT systems.\nA layered defence for ICT systems with adequate monitoring and reporting is essential for achieving protection from a large variety of attack vectors. This requires a lifecycle approach that incorporate “secure by design”, “secure in implementation” and “secure during operation”. Custom-developed systems and software additionally require to be “secure during manufacture/ development”.\nDetect This technical function addresses the need for organisations to continuously observe, monitor, analyse, detect and classify threats emanating from anomalous events, activities, incidents, user behaviours, policy violations, infrastructure weaknesses, bypass of security controls, failures of security processes etc.\nContinuous monitoring, analysis and detection of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Indicators of Attacks (IoAs) is possible only through a proper collection and management of logs and other artefacts generated by the digital ecosystem.\nThe detect function at the organisation level must provide its observations to the central agencies for sectoral and national level situational awareness of potentially malicious activities in the national cyberspace.\nNote Information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) is the process of maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organisational risk management decisions. A robust ISCM program enables organisations to move from compliance-driven risk management to data-driven risk management that is based on collection, collation, analysis, and review of security-related information from every ICT device in the organisation.\nRespond This technical function addresses the need for organisations to act upon detected cyber incidents and cyber-attacks and respond to the same in order to contain/ mitigate their adverse impact.\nEffectiveness of the Incident Response (IR) strategies is based on prior planning, having clearly earmarked responsibilities/ actions, and periodic testing of standard operating procedures (SOPs).\nNational agencies have an important role of supporting the CSEs in their response to debilitating, high impact cyber-attacks.\nRecover This technical function addresses the need for organisations to rapidly restore the business, IT and OT functions and/ or services that were impaired due to cyber-attack. This function is deemed to be successfully achieved when the services are restored with consistent data and the process is completed within the mandated “Time to Recovery”.\nTip Recovery from debilitating (high impact) ransomware attacks calls for well-designed and properly executed practices and processes for immutable backup, business continuity and disaster recovery.\nIncident analysis of breaches and cyberattacks on CSEs is essential, not only for rapid recovery within the affected CSEs but also for prevention of similar attacks on other organisations. National agencies have an important role to play in this regard and should implement mechanisms to ensure availability of essential logs (evidence) for carrying out necessary analysis. Automation of evidence recording by the technical functions is critical for rapid and effective incident handling. Entities should also endeavour to maintain voluntary information security sharing policy to enable broader cyber security awareness. Further, lessons from such information shared by other entities must be carefully perused to evaluate influence on internal cyber security functions.\nGovern \u0026 Administer This management function addresses the need for organisations to develop policies, practices, processes and oversight mechanisms for governance and administration of people, processes, and systems on a day-to-day and periodic basis. It is based on establishing and maintaining an enterprise cybersecurity program and an ISMS that provides governance, planning, and operations support to the organisation’s cybersecurity activities. It includes practices and processes for planning and design of applicable guidelines and cyber security policies for the cyber-governance program and identification of risk to formulate mitigation strategy. Audit and compliance requirements are also covered under this function.\nAcquire \u0026 Provision This management function addresses the need for organisations to develop policies, practices, processes and oversight mechanisms for acquisition and provisioning of trustworthy systems. It is primarily focused on conceptualisation, design, acquisition, and engineering of secure and trustworthy systems through a project-driven approach. It also includes supply chain risk management, covering systems, software, services, and workforce resources.\nRegulators and national nodal agencies have a role in shaping policies, procedures, and guidelines for CSEs, specifically for acquisition of their critical systems, processes, services, and workforce. National initiatives for trusted supply chains are under design for supporting the CSEs through regulatory mechanisms.\nOperate \u0026 Maintain This management function addresses the need for organisations to develop policies, practices, processes and oversight mechanisms for secure operations and maintenance of systems. It covers the entire gamut of people, processes, systems, and services.\nIt is generally observed that many entities assign the IT security functions to their IT workforce, whose responsibilities and primarily in IT operations. It is paramount for organisations to segregate responsibility at working level between IT operations and IT security functions and allocate separate resources for operation and management of IT security functions.\nAnalyse \u0026 Investigate This management function addresses the need for organisations to continually analyse threats and risks and design, develop, test, implement, analyse, and improve the functions, thereby improving the cyber resilience of the organisation. Threat modelling, performance measurement and evidence collection are essential for any analysis to be effective. The evidence collection should also support investigations that may be triggered by multiple events like cyber incident report, new acquisition, observations during internal / external VAPT etc.\nTrain \u0026 Enable This management function addresses the need for organisations to train the IT Operations and IT Security workforce and other employees (users of IT services) in all the above-mentioned functions. The training must consider the next-generation technologies like AI and evolution in the cyber security domain. Workforce enablement is achieved through the development of organisational culture in which the workforce is encouraged to operate as a team, be accountable and empowered to take decisions within their scope of responsibility and authority.\nApplication of Capability Framework There is a generalised relationship between the management functions and the capability framework:\nThe functions ‘Acquire \u0026 Provision’ and ‘Operate \u0026 Maintain’ represent the two major lifecycle stages of systems in CSEs. These functions will help the CSE to become “smart”, efficient and effective over time.\nThe functions ‘Analyse \u0026 Investigate’ and ‘Train and Enable’ will help enhance the CSE’s organisational culture for developing “resilience” through continuous improvement.\nThe ‘Govern \u0026 Administer’ function encompasses everything and enables the CSEs to have a long term “sustainability” approach.\nElements of Resilience and Sustainability In general, cyber resilience is achievable through well-designed operating procedures, processes, and practices, while sustainability is achievable through a combination of institutional structures, people, policies, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) mechanisms. High levels of cyber resilience and sustainability are largely achievable using technology and automation operated by skilled personnel. These are further described below.\nResilience Drivers In the context of cybersecurity, resilience is usually achieved through:\nwell-designed cyber secure architecture that incorporates the concepts of defense-in-depth and supports the processes and people responsible for its protection.\nresponsive operating practices and processes to achieve resilience, such as:\nkeep the defenses and all possible attack routes under 24 x 7 watch (Logging, SOC).\nquick response to anomalous activities that are observed by the SOC (IR).\nrapidly carrying out defensive actions against materialized attacks (EDR, XDR, SOAR).\nmitigate the impact of any successful penetration through the defenses (CCMP, BCP).\na skilled and trained workforce is essential for successfully executing the operating processes.\nSustainability Drivers In the context of cybersecurity, sustainability is usually achieved by:\nhaving the right cybersecurity policies in place.\nsmart mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness of implementation and operation of the policies on ground.\na culture of continuous improvement within the entities.\nStrategic Program Management Resilience and sustainability of IT and Information Security are strategic goals of organisations. Hence, they must be driven by the top leadership and management, who must take a long-term strategic view of both the use of IT to achieve business objectives and use of Information and Cyber Security to protect IT and business. Governing bodies and top leadership should assess whether they have adequate in-house capabilities to strategise on these two goals or they require external expertise to support their leaders and teams.\nA smart, resilient, and sustainable federated digital ecosystem is achieved only when it is driven by the top leadership. It is a good practice to have a strategic program management team that regularly consults, analyses and reports to the top management whether the organisation’s digital ecosystem sufficiently:\nEnables and supports the business requirements. Protects information and information infrastructure in cyberspace. Minimises weaknesses, vulnerabilities and risks through defensive actions. Detects failures and cyber exploits. Responds rapidly and effectively to IT and cyber incidents. Recovers quickly from disruptions and cyber-attacks with minimal damage. Is governed, administered, engineered, operated, maintained and managed by a competent workforce, through institutionalised practices and processes, supported by technology, platforms and tools. A right combination of people, processes, technology and governance is essential for organisations to leverage the digital ecosystem to accomplish the organisation’s mission, fulfil the legal and regulatory requirements, maintain the day-to-day functions, and protect the assets and individuals.\nCapability Maturity Models This is described in detail here.",

    "content": "The NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for accreditation of IT and ICS Consultancy Organisations (COs) is an initiative of the Government to develop a pool of specialist organisations that can help CSEs in handling the different dimensions of work related to the digital ecosystem.\n‘Consultancy’ is the act of providing technical expertise, by an individual or an organisation deemed competent in delivering services as per the defined scope in exchange for a fee. The nature of such expertise may be technical, thematical, procedural or managerial.\nDomains Organisations can usually group their work of handling their digital infrastructure into multiple domains as given here and also tabulated below. Each of these domains are inherently complex and dynamic and require a substantial depth and breadth of knowledge, expertise and skills to do the work.\n. Domain Type Domain Title 1 Organisational Governance, Risk and Compliance 2 Technical Technology \u0026 System Security Architecture 3 Technical Secure Software Development 4 Technical Application Security Testing 5 Technical Security Product Testing 6 Technical Network Security Administration 7 Technical System Security Administration 8 Technical Applications \u0026 Data Security Administration 9 Technical Security Support Services 10 Technical Security Performance Management 11 Technical ICS Cyber Security 12 Technical ICS Cyber Risk Assessor 13 Technical ICS Cybersecurity Design, \u0026 Implementation 14 Technical ICS Cybersecurity Operations \u0026 Maintenance 15 Technical Cyber Defence 16 Technical Cyber Vulnerability, Threat \u0026 Risk Management 17 Technical Security Operations 18 Technical Cyber Forensics \u0026 Investigation 19 Organisational Cyber Training \u0026 Awareness Typical domain ownership and responsibility is described below.\nDomain 1 is related to IT/ ICS GRC under the CISO.\nDomains 2 to 5 \u0026 13 are related to design, engineering and implementation of IT/ ICS systems by project engineering teams, under the project management organisation.\nDomains 6 to 11 \u0026 14 are related to cyber security aspects for consideration by the IT \u0026 ICS teams under the CIO/ OT Head.\nDomains 12, 15 to 18 are exclusively related to cyber security functions by the IS \u0026 SOC teams under the IT / OT CISO.\nDomain 19 is related to training under Head HR.\nWork Heads CSEs find it a challenge to hire sufficient in-house resources for all the domains and functions. Hence, they look for competent, capable and trustworthy Consultancy Organisations, who can do some of the work for them.\nThe Scheme has defined 11 Work Heads for COs, which are aligned to the work domains within organisations as shown in the table below.\nWH-Id Title of Consultancy Service (Work Head) Related Domain (indicative) WH-1 Designing and facilitation of implementation of CSMS (L1/L2/L3) with focus on Governance, Risk and Compliance Requirements Domain 1 (Governance, Risk and Compliance) WH-2 IT Cyber Security, Architecture, Design, Engineering and Implementation Domain 2 (Technology \u0026 System Security Architecture)\nDomain 3 (Secure Software Development)\nDomain 4 (Application Security Testing)\nDomain 5 (Product Security Testing) WH-3 IT Cyber Security Administration and Management Domain 6 (Network Security Administration)\nDomain 7 (System Security Administration)\nDomain 8 (Applications \u0026 Data Security Administration)\nDomain 9 (Security Support Services)\nDomain 10 (Security Performance Management) WH-4 ICS Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Domain 12 (ICS Cyber Risk Assessor) WH-5 ICS Cybersecurity Architecture, Design, Engineering and Implementation Domain 13 (ICS Cybersecurity Design, \u0026 Implementation) WH-6 ICS Cybersecurity Operations \u0026 Maintenance Domain 14 (ICS Cybersecurity Operations \u0026 Maintenance) WH-7 Cyber Defence Domain 15 (Cyber Defence) WH-8 Cyber Security Monitoring and Assessment Domain 16 (Cyber Vulnerability, Threat \u0026 Risk Management) WH-9 Cyber Security Operations Domain 17 (Security Operations) WH-10 Cyber Security Forensics \u0026 Investigation Domain 18 (Cyber Forensics \u0026 Investigation) WH-11 Cyber Training \u0026 Skill Gap Assessments Domain 19 (Cyber Training \u0026 Awareness) CXOs can use the mapping of domains to each WH Id to identify who can do what work.\nThe detailed scope of consultancy work/ services is described in a separate table in the Scheme. This table can be used by the stakeholders in the manner given below:\nCSEs can use the table to describe the work/ services sought from the consultancy organisations in different domains. Contents of the table can be suitably adapted for inclusion in the RFPs. COs can use the table to identify what work/ services they can do/ want to do. This activity will be done at the time of applying for accreditation and during the accreditation process. ABs can use the table to validate that the COs have the capability to deliver all of the work/ service described under the Work Heads for which they have sougt accreditation. Regulators and nodal agencies can use the table to review the capability of COs hired by the regulated entities. This activity is usually required when there are serious lapses in the quality of work done by the COs for the entities. Note Lapses in the quality of work/ services of COs is often due to lack of competence in the professionals provided by the COs to the entities. It may also be due to gaps in the work package given to the COs.\nThe Scheme has a well-defined redressal process to address the issues related to capabilities and competencies of COs.\nAccreditation of COs Accreditation Bodies (AB) are responsible for accreditation of COs under the Scheme. During the accreditation process, the CO shall be attested for their capability, competence and level of expertise to provide consultancy service as per the detailed scope of work/ services tabulated above.\nThe accreditation process requires the CO to demonstrate to the AB that their consultants/ professionals have the required competency (knowledge, skills and advanced/ master level expertise) to deliver the services. The Scheme tabulates the knowledge and skill requirements for the consultants/ professionals, which is derived from the Scheme for Cybersecurity Professionals.\nThe evidence of competency is usually demonstrated through global certifications and documented work experience of the professionals.\nOnce accredited, the CO can offer their services as a whole package or parts of it, depending on the scope chosen and the services sought by the client.\nGuidance CSEs must leverage the robust mechanism of the NCIIPC-QCI Scheme to accredit skilled consultancy organisations. The CSEs can hire COs to become a part of their composite workforce and handle portions of the work of conceptualisation, design, engineering, acquisition, operation and management of their digital infrastructure.",

    "content": "Business and technical stakeholders, both within and outside the CSEs, need a common vocabulary to describe different perspectives of IT and cybersecurity within the national cyberspace. This section defines an ontology of tags that categorises various characterstiscs of a federated digital ecosystem. The tags will enable a common specification, representation and communication of the use of IT and cybersecurity amongst the governing bodies, top and senior management and technical teams, both within entities and the external organisations interacting with the entities.\nThree tag-groups are defined, as under:\nA. Resource categorisation\nB. Hierarchical level\nC. Trust level\nThe ontology is designed in a technology-agnostic manner so that it can understood by both business and technical persons. The tags are meant to be used in architecture diagrams and presentations to give the business and technical management a common mechanism to specify the characteristics of IT and cybersecurity elements in the federated digital ecosystem. They are also to be used in discussions with external organiations. The objective is to facilitate common understanding of situations and enable appropriate decision-making.\nA. Resource Categorisation Tags The resource categorisation tags are designed for use by the technology level practitioners to establish a common understanding with the goveranance and business levels about the type and level of control they have over their information infrastructure elements. The list of tags in this group are as under:\nResource zones - central (S) or end-user (U). In-use resources purpose and use – functional (FS, FU) or governance/ management/ administration (GS, GU). Connectivity zones (V). Data centre ownership (SA, SB, SC, SD). Connectivity ownership (VA, VB, VC, VD). Connectivity purpose and use (XA, XB, XC, XD). End user resource ownership (UA, UB, UC, UD). End user role (NU, OU). Control over human workforce (WA, WB, WC, WD). Services (DC, IS, OS, TS, SS, FM). Service ownership (JA, JB, JC, JD). Data centre segmentation (ML1 to ML4). Cloud services segmentation (YL0 to YL4) Resource Zones The resource zones are of two types:\nCentral Resource Zones (S Zones): These zones host the in-use operating resources (servers, applications, databases) of different business processes and management systems, as well as the local networking and security infrastructure. The central zones are located physically within the data centres or the local server rooms in regional/ branch offices. These zones are tagged as System or ‘S’ zones.\nEnd User Resource Zones (U Zones): These zones host the in-use operating resources (computing devices, applications, data repositories) of end users and their local networking and security infrastructure. The users may be human or machine and are typically identified by their credentials (user and machine ids) that are linked to centrally managed user and system accounts. The user zones are generally located physically within the office premises of organisations or work/ home premises of remote users. These zones are tagged as User or ‘U’ zones.\nIn-Use Resources Computer resources (assets) of entities may lie in the store or be deployed for use. The resources deployed and in-use in central and end-user zones can be categorised as under, based on their purpose and use. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘S’ or ‘U’:\nTag Resource Use Type Resource Use Description FS, FU Functional Use The resources are used for business functions, services, operations, and analytics. These include computer resources (web servers, app servers, db servers, etc) of different critical business/ industrial processes. GS. GU Governance, Management and Administration Use The resources are used for governance, management, and administration. These include computer resources to configure, manage, monitor, control, analyse and report the functional, performance and cybersecurity aspects of the computer resources deployed in the operational zones. Notes:\nTypically, the resources used for operational and management functions are physically and logically segmented into separate sub-zones within the hierarchical levels described in later sections.\nThe in-use computer resources (assets) of an organisation can be categorised and tagged based on their functions and capabilities, as well as by the zones in which they are deployed. The tags can be used to apply detailed guidance on the information security imperatives and requirements of each in-use resource based on its function and the zone in which it is deployed.\nTypes of Functional Resources (FS, FU Tag) The detailed categorisation of computer resources based on the functions and capabilities is described in a separate section. The in-use computer resources can usually be tagged as under.\nEnd User Resources: User and machine credentials stored in smart cards, USB tokens or 2FA through mobile devices. Endpoint computing devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile) Audio and video conferencing devices Wired and wireless network access devices, Bluetooth, Zigbee, WLAN SSL VPN termination, VPN clients Applications and data repositories Endpoint agents installed on compute devices. Cloud Services and Resources: Subscription Services: Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), As-a-Service Applications (email, portal, eOffice etc), CTI Feeds. Perimeter Devices: Perimeter zones will have connectivity devices that provide physical and logical conduit between the two zones and physical (human) and logical (network) ingress/ egress control devices (gateway), data diode. Firewall, IDS, IPS, UTM, NAC appliance, Router, switch, VPN gateway, SSL terminator, communication network termination device, OT: GPRS modem, FO modem, smartcard/ biometric readers, network taps, IPSEC/ SSL VPN termination points. Data Centre Resources: Web Proxy, Email Proxy, API gateway, Load Balancer, Data Leakage Protection, Content Disarm \u0026 Reconstruct (CDR), Switch Enterprise Zone Data Centre (segmented into multiple trust zones (VLANs), based on functional and security design): server cluster, server farm, VMs and containers, storage, consoles, SW stack, business systems (ERP) Datacentre network (DCN), compute, VMs and containers. Zones specific to OT and IIoT: OT supervisory L2: Industrial PCs, SCADA, DCS, HMI, FEP, Historian, Engineering Workstation, switch OT basic control L1: PLC, RTU, IED, BCU IIoT edge devices L1: surveillance cameras, biometric and smart card readers OT L0: relay, sensor, actuator, generic OT process devices Types of Governance and Management Resources (GS Tag) These resources can be broadly categorised as:\nPlatforms that discover, provision, configure, monitor, manage functionality, performance, and security, visualise, control, analyse, govern, and report the trustworthiness (functionality and assurance) of operational systems (computer resources). Cloud Services Management (Infrastructure, Platforms, Software, Security, Backup, BCP, DR services), Domain management, SMIME/ SSL certificate management, email, and web services. Subscription feeds: OEM Patches and Feeds, OEM telemetry collectors, AV/ EPP management, Domain manager, Certificate Authority, OAuth IdPs. Datacentre network (DCN) management: physical access control, CCTV monitoring, BIMS, UPS \u0026 Generators DNS, DHCP, RADIUS, network access control (NAC) management. Management platforms and tools: IT/OT asset management (ITAM), asset configuration management (CMDB), asset discovery, IdAM (AD) \u0026 privileged identity and access management, LDAP, credential management, API secrets management, certificate management, NMS/EMS, patch management, vulnerability \u0026 compliance management, database activity monitoring (DAM), key lifecycle management (KLM), policy management, SSH management, log \u0026 flow collectors, SIEM, EDR, NDR, XDR, SOAR, endpoint/ AV protection (EPP), forensic tools, ITSM, ISMS, BCMS, data backup. Log collection from all in-use computer resources and flow collection from all networks. Connectivity Zones These zones host the Wide Area Network (WAN) network provider infrastructure that provide the conduits for voice, video, and data connectivity between the resource zones. The connectivity zones are usually owned and managed by TSPs and ISPs and are accessed by means of customer premises equipment (CPE) that are installed in the resource zones connecting to the WAN. These zones are tagged as ‘V’ zones, say Connectivity Zone.\nThe connectivity (V) zone of an entity is, in effect, a resource (S) zone of the TSP and ISP.\nData Centre Ownership All data centres and server rooms hosting the central resources are categorised as under, based on their ownership. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘S’:\nTag Data Centre Type Data Centre Description SA Entity Owned Captive data centres and server rooms owned by the entity. SB GOE Owned Data centres of Govt Owned Entity (NIC, SDCs, PSUs). SC Privately Owned Data centres of Privately Owned CSP, India based DC facilities. SD Privately Owned Data centres of Privately Owned CSP, multi country DC facilities. Notes:\nThe above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk and compliance aspects of data centre and cloud service providers, while providing strategic direction to the use of IT. For example, the risk of non-compliance of data localisation requirement is higher in the case of Type SD as compared to Type SC.\nTag SA entity owned private cloud is exclusive to the organisation, which may be hosted on-premises or in a site hired from a property owner. This corresponds to the pattern where an organisation provides its own captive cloud services.\nTag SB GOE owned cloud is typically mandated for almost all the critical business functions of CSEs. Many common services like email, portals, eOffice and other IaaS/ PaaS/ SaaS/ DRaaS are provided as cloud services to the Govt Community.\nTag SC private cloud service providers with India-only data centres are easily able to comply with data localisation requirements that can be verified using lower levels of audit effort. Such CSP data centres are preferable when data localisation requirement as well as control over data storage outside of India is of high priority.\nTag SD private cloud service providers with multi-country data centres include the i) the likes of global CSPs like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle, SAP; ii) OEM service management related to OEM patches, vulnerability feeds and sending system telemetry back to the OEMs, specifically relevant to OT OEM support services that are provided from OEM support cloud installations.; iii) third-party managed services (MSPs and MSSPs) covering both Indian and non-Indian ownership and control; iv) content delivery network (CDN) providers; v) domain name providers, digital certificate issuers, PKI management providers like DigiCert, DNS and other security service providers like Cloudflare etc.\nThe key advantages of tag SD CSPs are that they can provide very high levels of infrastructure scaling, availability, and business continuity. A large pool of trained and experienced professionals is also available for such CSPs, and these professionals can be easily hired to manage and secure the zones implemented in these CSP data centres. These CSPs can comply with data residency within the Indian geography but cannot easily prove compliance that data is not also residing outside of India. Significant audit effort is required to verify the same. Hence, such CSP data centres are relevant when an organisation requires very high and dynamic scalability or has to provide its services beyond the national boundaries or when there are no major concerns related to copies of data being stored outside of India.\nConnectivity Ownership These zones host the Wide Area Network (WAN) network provider infrastructure that provide the conduits for voice, video, and data connectivity between the resource zones. These zones are tagged as ‘V’ zones.\nThe connectivity providers are categorised as under, based on their ownership. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘V’:\nTag Connectivity Type Connectivity Description VA Entity Owned Captive WAN and mobile networks owned by the entity. VB GOE Owned WAN and mobile networks of Govt Owned Entity (NICNET, NKN, PSUs). VC Privately Owned Networks of Private TSP/ ISP, managed from India based facilities (Airtel, Reliance, Vodafone-Idea). VD Privately Owned Networks of Private TSP/ISP managed from outside India. Example, global satellite communication providers. Notes:\nThe above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of connectivity providers (TSPs/ ISPs), while providing strategic direction to the use of IT. For example, the national security risk due to misuse of the monitored traffic patterns is higher in the case of Type VD as compared to Types VA, VB, or VC.\nConnectivity Use The connectivity can be categorised as under, based on the purpose and use. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘X’, to identify the network topography:\nTag Characteristics of Connectivity XA Closed user group (CUG). XB Intra-organisation: Intranet (WAN), local area network (LAN), data centre networking (DCN). XC Inter-organisation: Extranet (WAN). XD Public: Internet. Tag XA is typically used for high security closed user groups, which use captive networks or encryption devices on less secure networks. Entities also use VPN to create closed user groups for privileged users, who typically have to connect to the data centres to provide remote support.\nTag XB is typically used for intranet connectivity of regional and branch offices through MPLS Cloud, Leased Lines or Site-to-Site VPNs. This also includes remote OT cells/ areas within an OT Site that typically connect to the OT site operations/ DMZ on wired LAN.\nTag XC is typically used for extranet connectivity through MPLS Cloud, Leased Lines or Site-to-Site VPNs. Examples are RBI Infinet, NIC NKN, Power sector grid operation networks between substations and control centres etc.\nTag XD is typically used for internet connectivity through wired/ wireless broadband and mobile networks provided by the Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\nEnd User Resource Ownership The end user resource ownerships are categorised as under, based on the organisation to which the human user or machine belongs. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘U’:\nTag User Org Type User Organisation Description UA Own Organisation Human user or machine belongs to the entity itself. UB Other Organisation Human user or machine belongs to another entity with which there is a formal and established relationship. UC Other Organisation Human user or machine belongs to another entity with which there is no formal or established relationship. UD No Organisation Human user or machine does not belong to any entity, viz a private individual or his machine. Notes:\nThe above categorisation helps\nthe design and implementation teams and the operations managers to establish and ensure appropriate controls in different end user zones. the top and senior management to monitor the risks. the audit teams to check policy non-compliances. Entities have a high level of control over tag UA resources, whether they are used for connecting through the Internet or Intranet. The organisation can enforce that the end-user devices must have adequate endpoint protection (AV, anti-malware etc) and comply with organisational policies (patches/ updates, upgrades, password policy enforcement, authorised applications, VPN usage etc). These controls can even be enforced and centrally managed on the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) of remote workers.\nEntities have a lower level of control over tag UB, UC resources that belong to other Organizations. In most cases, the user’s organisation is responsible for configuring, securing, and managing the end user resources. Other organisation’s users (humans and machines) typically connect to one’s own organisation’s information infrastructure through the Extranet. Other organisation users may also connect using IPSEC or SSL VPNs over the Internet. One’s own organisation must depend upon the other organisation’s policies and processes of control over the end-user devices in terms of their endpoint protection and compliance to policies. Formal and established relationships between entities help to increase the trust in the human users and machines of the other entities.\nEntities do not have any control over tag UD resources, the end-user devices of public users, who connect to organisation’s information infrastructure through the Internet, typically using browser or mobile applications. Machine to machine connections from public users/ Organizations to an organisation’s systems are generally API-based.\nEnd User Role The end user resources are categorised as under, based on the role of the human user or machine. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘U’:\nTag User Role Type User Role Description NU Normal User Human user or machine carries out normal functions and activities. OU Privileged User Human user or machine carries out privileged functions and activities. These include all types of administrators, service accounts, remote support providers etc. Business users with high levels of decision and approval powers can also be called privileged users. Notes:\nEnd user zones with privileged users (OU) are a higher risk to the entity than those with normal users (NU) only. Such zones therefore need to be governed and managed with greater focus and may call for increased surveillance and compliance.\nPrivileged Users (OU) can be grouped as\ntechnical persons and machines (administrators, OEM remote support etc). business and special users accessing sensitive information (e.g., regulatory \u0026 statutory auditors). Human Workforce Control The human workforce for operating and managing the central resources and connectivity of entities are categorised as under, based on the entity’s level of control on the technical, administrative, physical and IT access control aspects of the workforce. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘W’:\nTag Workforce Type Workforce Technical, Administrative and Access Control WA Entity’s own employees Technical functions: controlled by the entity Administrative functions: controlled by the entity Physical \u0026 IT access: controlled by the entity WB Workforce hired/ contracted by the entity Technical functions: controlled by the entity Administrative functions: controlled by the HR supplier Physical \u0026 IT access: controlled by the entity WC Workforce of outsourced services providers\n(OEM Partners and SI Support Teams) Technical functions: controlled by the service provider Administrative functions: controlled by the service provider Physical \u0026 IT access: controlled by the entity within the entity’s premises. WD Workforce of OEM and Managed Services Providers (providing remote services) Technical functions, administrative functions and IT access to the entity resources are all controlled by the OEM or the Managed Services Provider (MSP, MSSP). Physical entry into the entity’s premises is not required for this workforce since all work is done remotely. Notes:\nThe technical functions related to the workforce covers aspects of skill assessment and verification during workforce hiring, tasking of individuals, leave management and management of replacements during leave or exit. This is done by the organisation themselves for resource categories WA and WB or by the service provider for resource categories WC and WD. Some Organizations also invest into the technical skill development of their WB resources (contractual employees).\nThe administrative functions related to the workforce covers aspects of skill verification and documentation during workforce onboarding, contract management, compliance to laws and regulation. This is done by the organisation itself for its own employees under resource category WA or by the resource/ service provider for resource categories WB, WC, and WD. Some Organizations manage the compensation payments and payment of GST for resource categories WB by themselves, while others let the workforce resource provider do the same.\nThe physical and IT access control of the workforce covers aspects of physical entry into the organisation’s premises and places of work within the organisation. It also covers access to IT and OT resources, both on-premises and remotely through the network. All Organizations control the physical access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC. The Organizations also control the IT access of people resources under resource categories WA, WB, and WC when they are on the organisation’s premises. In case of remote working of WC and WD category workforce, the service providers decide which person is assigned to remotely manage their customer organisation’s IT / OT infrastructure and further controls the IT access of the assigned resource as per the SLAs signed with the customer organisation.\nThe above workforce control categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate and provide strategic direction on the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of i) the workforce employed to operate and manage their central resources in data centres, and ii) the workforce employed by their outsourced and managed service providers (WC and WD).\nFor example, the risk of data leakage is higher from those providers of outsourced and managed services (WC, WD), who do not have good due diligence processes to hire, train and monitor their own and contractual employees, or they are further outsourcing the work to second tier service providers. Due diligence is especially important for workforce having privileged user (OU) rights.\nA strategic assessment of the level of control available to an entity with regard to the outsourced workforce (WC and WD) operating and managing its resource and connectivity zones would help the entity identify the SLAs that should be in place with the outsourced and managed service providers. The SLAs should especially cover the control, monitoring, and oversight on the privileged users (OU) of the service providers since these highly skilled users generally work remotely.\nService Ownership The modern federated digital ecosystem is largely driven by services. In general, a Service Provider Entity (SPE) delivers a service to a Customer Entity (CE), who acquires the service. The relationship between the SPE and the CE may be formal, semi-formal or informal, depending upon the type of service agreements that exist between them.\nThe services related to IT, OT and Information Security infrastructure are categorised as under:\nData Centre Services (DC): These are typically provided by Cloud Service Provider Entities (CSP). Telecom and Internet Services (IS): These services include voice, video and data communication services that are provided by telecom and internet service provider entities (TSP, ISP). Operation Support Services (OS): These services include NOC, SOC, call centres, customer service centres etc. Technology Support services (TS): These services include L1 to L3 support services and managed services that are usually provided by second- or third-party entities such as OEMs and/or their partners, SIs, MSPs, MSSPs etc. These services are usually contracted with formal service level agreements between the customer (CE) and the service provider entity (SPE). Subscription services (SS): These services include all types of subscriptions and are typically in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feeds, vulnerability, and compliance (SCAP) feeds, open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds, remote health monitoring service etc. These services may either be i) contracted by the CE with formal service level agreements with the SPE, or ii) non-contracted best effort services that have no formal SLAs between the CE and the SPE. The SPEs themselves may be source (feed) owners or feed aggregators. Non**-IT Facility Management Services** (FM): These services include power supply, site, and facility management (physical security, non-IT infrastructure) services etc. In the modern federated digital ecosystem, the SPE and the CE may be different entities by themselves or may be different business units within large Organizations and the Government (e.g. NIC and SDCs are SPEs to govt departments (CEs)).\nThe SPEs are categorised as under, based on their ownership and location. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘J’:\nTag SPE Type Service Provider Entity Description JA Entity Owned Services owned, managed, and consumed by the entity itself (captive). JB GOE Owned Services owned, managed, and delivered by Govt Owned Entity. JC Privately Owned Services delivered by Private SPEs from India based facilities. JD Privately Owned Services delivered by Private SPEs from outside India facilities. Notes:\nTag JA SPE corresponds to the pattern where an entity has its own captive services.\nTag JB SPEs usually provide DC, IS, OS, TS, SS and FM services by government owned entities to CSEs.\nTag JC SPEs deliver their services from India based facilities.\nTag JD SPEs deliver their services from outside India facilities.\nThe above categorisation helps the governing bodies and top management of entities to evaluate the governance, risk, and compliance aspects of service provider entities, while providing strategic direction to the use of IT, OT, and Information security services. For example, the risk of disruption of service caused by changes in the local country regulations is higher in the case of type JD as compared to type JC, while it is very low for types of JA and JB.\nMany Govt owned SPEs (tag JB) such as CERT-In, NCIIPC, CSIRTS etc provide Cyber Threat Intel feeds that are aggregated and enhanced by them.\nSegmentation of Data Centres It is evident that data centres and server rooms of entities are the most critical elements of an entity’s use of IT for achieving business objectives.\nData centre premises and contents can be segmented, based on the legal ownership of the i) physical property that hosts the data centre, usually managed by the property manager (FM-SPE), ii) the data centre facility or site itself, including the IT and non-IT infrastructure installed in the facility and owned by the Data Centre Service Provider Entity (DC-SPE), iii) supporting infrastructure of the facility (power, telecom, physical security) provided by the Facility Management Service Provider Entity (FM-SPE), and iv) platforms and services provided by the DC-SPE to the customers and users (CE). The segmentation levels are defined in the table below. The levels are prefixed with the tag ‘ML’.\nTag Segmentation Level Type and Description ML1 Physical property hosting the DC - buildings, civil infrastructure ML2 Physical DC site premises - IT and non-IT infrastructure ML3 Support facilities - power, telecom, physical security ML4 Customer owned resources within the DC – co-located resources and subscribed resources In almost all cases, the legal owners are responsible for the operations, management, security, legal and regulatory compliance functions of their segments. They are also responsible for the workforce handling these functions. For example,\nML1 is owned, operated, managed, and secured by the Property Manager (FM-SPE), who is responsible for ingress/ egress control into the property, campus security and safety. The workforce handling these functions are contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).\nML2 is owned by the DC-SPE and managed by the DC Site Manager, who is responsible for DC operations and management. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the DC-SPE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).\nML3 is owned by the FM-SPE, who are responsible for operations and management of their services. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the FM-SPE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).\nML4 is owned by the Customer Entity (CE), who is responsible for the operations and management of their platforms and subscribed services. The workforce handling these functions are a mix of the CE’s own employees (WA), contract workforce (WB) or outsourced services (WC).\nIn the case of entity owned data centres and server rooms (SA), the entity is both the DC-SPE and the CE. In case the entity also owns the inter-data centre and customer connectivity (VA), then the entity is also the IS-SPE for its intranet connectivity facilities.\nIn other cases (SB, SC, SD), there is a supplier and acquirer relationship between the DC-SPE and CE regarding the provisioning and use of cloud services. Cloud service customers can also consider multiple cloud service providers together as a cloud services supply chain.\nThe IS/ISO/IEC 27036: Part 4:2016 provides guidance on supplier relationship between the cloud service customer (acquirer) and the cloud service provider (supplier). IS/ISO/IEC 27002 clause 15 “Supplier relationships” provides controls, implementation guidance and other information for managing information security in supplier relationships. IS/ISO/IEC 27017:2015 provides guidelines on information security controls suitable for cloud services provision and usage, that can provide guidance to the DC-SPE and the CE. The DC-SPEs also obtain certification of compliance to various standards that are applicable to cloud services, such as IS/ISO/IEC 20000-1, SOC-2 etc. These standards are described in the compendium.\nAs per industry practice, the resource provisioning and orchestration functions are carried out by the DC-SPE. However, the responsibility of operation, management and security of customer subscribed data centre resources is shared between the DC-SPE and CE based on the type of cloud computing model that the CE has subscribed to from the DC-SPE. These are broadly classified into IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, XaaS etc. NIST SP 800-145, SP 500-292, and SP 500-332 provide detail guidance on cloud computing models.\nSegmentation of Cloud Services The cloud computing resource types given in the table below are adapted from the industry practice in a manner that it can also be applied to entity-owned captive data centres and GOE owned data centres. The tags are derived from the primary tag ‘Y’.\nTag Cloud Computing Resource Type \u0026 Description YL4 Function as a Service (backup, disaster recovery, virtual desktop, business continuity etc) YL3 Software as a service YL2 Platform as a service YL1 Infrastructure as a service YL0 Co-location service (using the data centre premises for locating customer resources) B. Hierarchical Level Tags The hierarchical level tags are designed to provide a common classification mechanism for different zones of the information infrastructure. This will help the project design and engineering teams, procurement, and provisioning teams, IT and information security operations management teams and the service providers in better risk analysis and allocation of various resources. The tags in this group are as under:\nCentral resource hierarchy of zones (HL0 to HL5). Perimeter zones between hierarchical zones (PHL1 to PHL4.5). Perimeter zones in data centre segments (PM1 to PM4). Perimeter zones in cloud environment (PYL0 to PYL4). Central Resource Zones The central resource zones can be categorised into different hierarchical levels, which correspond to the hierarchy defined in the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) and other models. The hierarchical levels defined in the table below. The levels are prefixed with the tag ‘HL’.\nTag Hierarchical Level Type Hierarchical Level Characteristics HL5 Enterprise Systems Zone This level is physically or logically segmented into multiple operational, analytics and management zones, based on functional and security design. HL4.5 Enterprise DMZ Typically, the DMZs are physically or logically separate for the Internet, Intranet and Extranet zones HL4 Enterprise Systems Zone This level is physically or logically segmented into multiple operational, analytics and management zones, based on functional and security design. The tag may also be used to identify segmented IT operation zones and management zones inside the enterprise HL4 operations zone. HL3.5 OT Site DMZ\nBranch Office IT DMZ The OT DMZs typically host systems for controlled exchange of data between the level 3 site operations zone and the organisation’s level 4 enterprise zones, as well as with control centres established by other Organizations.\nThe IT DMZs function similar to level 4.5 enterprise DMZ HL3 OT Site Operations Zone\nBranch Office Server Zone The OT zone typically hosts systems for OT Site operations.\nThe server (IT) zone is similar to level 4 enterprise zone. The tag may also be used to identify segmented OT site operation zones and management zones within the OT site. HL2.5 OT Cell/Area DMZ The OT DMZ typically host systems for controlled exchange of data between the level 2 cell/ area and the level 3 site operations zone. HL2 OT Cell/Area Operations Zone Hosts the supervisory control resources like SCADA systems of the OT Cell/Area. HL1 OT Cell/Area Operations Zone\nIIoT Edge Zone Hosts the basic OT control resources like PLCs, RTUs, BCUs.\nHosts the IIoT edge devices like CCTV cameras, biometric \u0026 smart card readers, BIMS edge devices, relays etc HL0 OT Process Zone Hosts the OT process devices like sensors, actuators. Notes:\nThe hierarchical level tags can be used to tag various zones in system and network diagrams to establish a common framework for analysis and discussion on the IT, OT and IS aspects.\nThe Industrial IoT Reference Architecture (IIRA)1 is one of the foundational documents published by the Industry IoT Consortium (IIC) that describes the business \u0026 technology perspectives in the IIoT industry. Typically, IIoT system implementation is done in a generic three-tier architectural pattern that comprises of edge, platform, and enterprise tiers.\nThe tags described above can be broadly applied to the IIoT-based physical access control and monitoring setup in different entities as under:\nHL4 – enterprise tier, typically located in a separate zone within the entity’s central data centre. HL3 -platform tier, typically located in a separate zone within the entity’s OT site/ branch office. HL2 – edge tier, typically located within the entity’s area that is being secured and/ or observed. HL1/HL0 – edge nodes (IIoT devices like CCTV cameras, biometric and smart-card readers etc), typically located within the entity’s area that is being secured and/ or observed. XB - proximity network, typically the OT cell/ area/ site LAN or branch LAN XB, XC, XD – access network and service network, typically the intranet, extranet, internet Perimeter Zones between Hierarchical Levels Perimeter zones lie between two resource zones or between a resource zone and a connectivity zone. The perimeter zones host the security devices and systems (L3 and L7 firewalls, IDS, IPS), which control the network (electronic) and the physical ingress and egress through conduits between the two zones separated by the perimeter zone. These perimeter zones are tagged as ‘P’ zones.\nThe network perimeter zones typically host VPN gateways, jump servers, bastion servers and other systems that secure the electronic conduits established through the perimeter zones.\nThe physical perimeter zones typically host IT-enabled and IT-managed access control systems, such as biometric and smart-cards, for securing the physical ingress and egress of users and external devices into the operational resource zones.\nPerimeter zones can be tagged based on different aspects of their deployment characteristics.\nPerimeter tags defined below are in the context of separation between zones at different hierarchical levels or within the same hierarchical level. The PHLx.y tag indicates that the perimeter is of the zone at hierarchical level HLx.y, towards a zone that is of a higher level or same level.\nPerimeter Location Tag Perimeter Description PHL4.5 Perimeter of HL4.5 resource zone. This perimeter typically separates the enterprise DMZ from the Intranet (XB), Extranet (XC) and Internet (XD) connectivity zones. This perimeter zone usually controls the conduits that provide network ingress/ egress to systems and users of own organisation (UA), other Organizations (UB, UC) and public users (UD). PHL4 Perimeter of HL4 resource zone. This perimeter separates the enterprise DMZ from the enterprise level IT operation zone(s). The tag may also be used to identify logical perimeters between segmented IT operation zones and management zones inside the enterprise HL4 operations zone. PHL3.5 Perimeter of HL3.5 resource zone. This perimeter typically separates the OT site DMZ or the branch office IT DMZ from the Intranet (XB), Extranet (XC) and Internet (XD) connectivity zones. This perimeter zone usually controls the conduits that provide network ingress/ egress to systems and users of own organisation (UA), other Organizations (UB, UC) and public users (UD).\nIn a few cases PHL3.5 of an OT site or a branch office is an air-gapped perimeter does not allow any network access, only physical access into the HL3 zone. PHL3 Perimeter of HL3 resource zone. This perimeter separates the OT site/ branch office DMZ from the OT site / branch office operation zone(s). The tag may also be used to identify logical perimeters between segmented OT site operation zones and management zones within the OT site. PHL2.5 Perimeter of HL2.5 resource zone. This perimeter separates the OT cell/ area DMZ from the OT site operation zone(s).\nThis perimeter zone usually controls the conduits that provide both physical and network ingress/ egress to operational and management systems, as well as normal (NU) and privileged (OU) users, the latter including remote OEM support teams.\nPHL2.5 is a very critical perimeter in OT environments since it protects the highly sensitive HL2 OT cell/ area operations zone by strictly controlling access to the OT systems in the zone.\nIn many cases PHL2.5 of an OT cell/ area is an air-gapped perimeter does not allow any network access, only physical access into the HL2 zone. PHL2 Perimeter of HL2 resource zone. In an OT deployment, this tag represents the physical and network perimeter between HL2 and HL2.5 zones. The HL2 zone hosts the supervisory control resources like SCADA systems PHL1 Perimeter of HL1 resource zone. In an OT deployment, this tag represents the physical or network perimeter of an OT zone (e.g. bay) that hosts the basic control resources (PLCs, RTUs, BCUs, relays) and the process devices (sensors, actuators). Notes:\nRemote management of in-use resources is unavoidable in case service availability and uptime is of the order of 99.9% or higher. Modern best practices for OEM remote support focus on having well-designed and secure perimeters at different HLs and privileged access management processes that i) enforce compliance by the OEM support teams to the agreed remote management terms and conditions, ii) authenticate and authorise the OEM support teams to access the zones requiring remote support, iii) closely observe and record all the remote management activities of the OEM support teams, and iv) quickly respond to any anomalous behaviour.\nPerimeter Zones in Data Centre Segments Perimeter tags defined below are in the context of the data centre segment (ML) in which it exists, physical or logical.\nPerimeter Management Tag Perimeter Tag Description PML1 Physical property perimeter, managed by PO PML2 Physical DC site perimeter, both IT and non-IT, managed by DC-SPE PML3 Support facilities perimeter, managed by SP-SPE PML4 Customer owned perimeter within the DC, both co-located resources and subscribed resources, managed by CE Perimeter Zones in Cloud Environment Perimeter tags defined below are in the context of the cloud computing management.\nPerimeter Management Tag Cloud Computing Resource Perimeter Tag \u0026 Description PYL4 Perimeter of Function as a Service - backup, disaster recovery, virtual desktop, business continuity, Content Delivery (CDN), DNS, HTTPS (TLS) etc PYL3 Perimeter of Software as a service PYL2 Perimeter of Platform as a service PYL1 Perimeter of Infrastructure as a service PYL0 Perimeter of Co-location service Notes:\nPerimeters in the cloud environment are usually configured, secured, and managed by the organisation responsible for the same.\nZone-based Tags for Resources The in-use computer resources (assets) of an organisation can also be categorised and tagged based the zones in which they are deployed. This tagging can be used to apply the detailed guidance on the information security imperatives and requirements of each in-use resource based on the zone in which it is deployed. A sample table for tagging of computer resources based on their zones of deployment is given below.\nTag Zone Type Typical in-use resources deployed in the zone U User Zone (UA, UB, UC, UD, NU, OU) Functional resources: desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wired/ wireless LAN, CPEs (modems/dongles), biometric/ smart card readers, user identity certificates, audio \u0026 video conferencing devices.\nManagement resources: endpoint agents, device management X Connectivity zone (XA, XB, XC, XD) TSP and ISP resources (last-mile connectivity, MPLS/ mobile network cloud, management systems) HL5 As-a-Service subscriptions (provided by OEMs and other providers) Functional resources: Caching (CDN), CASB\nManagement resources: Domain management, DNS, TLS/SMIME certificate management, CTI feed subscriptions, OEM patch, update and upgrade management, OEM telemetry, anti-virus subscriptions, EPP/ EDR/ XDR subscriptions PHL4.5 Data Centre External Perimeter Functional resources: firewalls, IDS, IPS, UTMs, access/ edge routers, VPN gateways, SSL terminators, CPEs (Optimux, xDSL modems, wireless modems)\nManagement resources: log and flow collectors HL4.5 Enterprise DMZ Functional resources: web proxy server, email proxy server, API gateway, load balancer, data leakage protection (DLP)\nManagement resources: log and flow collectors PHL4 Data Centre Internal Perimeter Functional resources: firewalls, IDS, IPS, UTMs, L3 core switch, network access control (NAC) appliance\nManagement resources: log and flow collectors HL4 Enterprise Systems Functional resources: server clusters, server farms, VMs \u0026 containers, VLAN zones, storage, local consoles, software stack, packaged software (e.g. ERP), audio and video conferencing systems\nManagement resources: data centre network (DCN) \u0026 VLAN management, VM and container orchestration, DNS \u0026 DHCP servers, domain controllers, LDAP servers, IdAM, data backup, credentials/ certificates / API secrets management, privileged access management, asset management (ITAM), configuration management (CMDB), service management (SMS), system and network security management, physical access control management, CCTV management PHL3.5 Site/ Branch Office External Perimeter Functional resources: firewalls, IDS, IPS, UTMs, access/ edge router/ switch, VPN gateways, SSL terminators, CPEs (Optimux, xDSL modems, GPRS/5G/5G modems)\nManagement resources: log and flow collectors, network taps, physical access control systems HL3.5 OT Site DMZ\nBranch Office IT DMZ Functional resources: L2 switch, OT gateway server, web proxy server, content disarm and reconstruct (CDR) system.\nManagement resources: log and flow collectors PHL3 Site/ Branch Office Internal Perimeter Functional resources: firewalls, IDS, IPS, UTMs, L2 switch, wired/ wireless LAN, network access control (NAC) appliance.\nManagement resources: log and flow collectors HL3 OT Site Operations Rooms\nBranch Office Server Rooms Functional resources: local servers, local storage, local applications like web server, database server\nManagement resources: site/ BO system \u0026 LAN management, patch server, AV/ EPP server, log, and flow collectors PHL2.5 OT Cell/Area External Perimeter Functional resources: firewall/ UTM, OT site network/ WAN connection (edge router, L3/L2 switch), CPEs (GPRS modem), data diode\nManagement resources: active and passive log and flow collectors, network taps, physical access control systems HL2.5 OT Cell/Area DMZ Functional resources: Servers, OT software applications\nManagement resources: active and passive log and flow collectors PHL2 OT Cell/Area Operations Perimeter Functional resources: L2 switch, data diode\nManagement resources: network taps, physical access control systems HL2 OT Cell/Area Operations Functional resources: industrial PCs, SCADA, DCS, HMI, FEP, historian, engineering workstations\nManagement resources: local management tools, passive log, and flow collectors PHL1 OT Cell/Area Operations Perimeter Functional resources: L2 switch, data diode\nManagement resources: network taps, physical access control systems HL1 OT Cell/Area Operations\nIIoT Edge Functional resources: PLCs, RTUs, IEDs, BCUs, IIoT surveillance cameras, biometric/ smart card readers\nManagement resources: local management tools, passive log, and flow collectors HL0 OT Process Functional resources: sensors, actuators, relays. C. Trust Level Tags The trust level tags are designed to provide a common classification mechanism for evaluating and assigning a trust level to each zone of the information infrastructure. This will help the project design and engineering teams, cybersecurity experts, service providers, regulators and national bodies to converge on defining and ensuring a trustworthy digital ecosystem. The tags in this group are as under:\nTrust level (TL0 to TL5) The resource and connectivity zones can be categorised into different trust levels based on\nthe level of control an entity requires on a zone, or the level of control that an entity can assuredly implement on the resources within a zone. The trust levels are defined in the table below. The levels are prefixed with the tag ‘TL’.\nTag Trust Level Type Trust Level Characteristics TL5 Very High Trust Resource Zone: entity defines a maximal set of endpoint and network security policies for users, systems and data transfer in this Zone that should be complied with to be permitted to operate within the Zone.\nConnectivity Zone: entity defines a maximal set of network security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the entity. TL4 High Trust Same as TL5. TL3 Enhanced Trust Resource Zone: entity defines an enhanced set of endpoint and network security policies for users and systems in this Zone to comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone.\nConnectivity Zone: entity defines an enhanced set of network security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the entity. TL2 Standard Trust Resource Zone: entity defines a mandatory set of endpoint and network security policies for users and systems in the Zone to comply with, to be permitted to operate within the Zone.\nConnectivity Zone: entity defines a mandatory set of network security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the entity. TL1 Low Trust Resource Zone: entity defines a minimal set of endpoint and network security policies for users and systems in the Zone to comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone.\nConnectivity Zone: entity defines a minimal set of network security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the entity. TL0 No Trust Resource Zone: entity has no control on enforcement of any endpoint and network security policies over the users and systems in the Zone.\nConnectivity Zone: both the entity and the network connectivity provider have no control on enforcement of any network security policies in the Zone. Notes:\nThe trust level tags can be used to tag various zones in the functional, system and network diagrams to establish a common framework for analysis and discussion on IS aspects.\nColour tagged table of trust levels may be downloaded here.\nCategorisation of Zones based on Trust Levels Each Resource and Connectivity Zone described above can be assigned a Trust Level. The characteristics of trust that is applicable to a resource or connectivity is described below along with examples of the same.\nEvery computer resource has to:\nbe configured for functionality, performance, and assurance (controls) provide visibility and observability. be controlled. be governed through org policies. The trust level is a function of the ability of an entity to execute the above requirements.\nCharacteristics of Trust Levels Untrusted Zone Characteristics:\nWhen applied to a Resource Zone, it indicates that the organisation has no control over the users and systems in the Zone.\nWhen applied to a Connectivity Zone, it indicates that both the organisation and the network connectivity provider have no control over enforcement of any security policies in the Zone.\nApplicable to:\nPublic users and systems connecting through public networks. The organisation cannot enforce security policies on the users and systems. Neither the organisation nor the ISP can enforce any security policies for network traffic that passes through the public network.\nExamples:\nPublic users anonymously accessing an organisation’s website over the Internet or mobile network.\nLow Trust Zone Characteristics:\nWhen applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a minimal set of security policies that users and systems in the Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. Typically, no anonymous access is provided, and all users and systems must be registered with an organisation, using their username \u0026 password or allocated API secret.\nWhen applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of VPNs controlled by the organisation or a trustworthy network connectivity provider, who has well defined network security policies for the Connectivity Zone.\nApplicable to:\nExternal users and systems that can connect to an organisation’s zone after pre-registration and through session-based authentication, they are also required to use browser-based (https) or client-based VPNs, which are controlled by the organisation and governed by the organisation’s security policies.\nExternal users and systems of other Organizations connecting through trusted extranet connectivity providers.\nExamples:\nPublic users connecting to an organisation’s website through the Internet or mobile network using a browser or app-based SSL VPN and further logging into their user account before doing any further activity.\nApplications on the devices of public users and Organizations, which connect to an organisation’s API gateways by using registered API secrets.\nNICNET and NKN based extranets that provide network interconnectivity between different Organizations. The network connectivity provider defines the set of security policies that the organisational users and systems should comply with when they are connected to the network.\nRemote management and support provided by OEMs, System Integrators, Managed Service Providers (MSPs \u0026 MSSPs) from their support zones, which are governed by their own security policies. In these cases, the remote support providers either connect through VPN clients installed on their devices or there would be well-managed site-to-site VPNs between the customer and support provider Organizations.\nStandard Trust Zone Characteristics:\nWhen applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a mandatory set of security policies that users and systems in the Resource Zone should comply with, to be permitted to operate within the Zone. Typically, the organisation has mechanisms to verify that the systems are compliant to the mandatory set of policies (systems are patched, have anti-virus software with latest update, username and password are as per security policy etc) before they are permitted to access other Resource Zones.\nWhen applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a mandatory set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, these well-defined network security policies are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider.\nApplicable to:\nInternal users and systems of the organisation connecting through the organisation’s Intranet, which may be managed by the organisation itself or by trusted network connectivity providers.\nUsers and systems of different Organizations connecting through trusted network, all of which are governed by a common set of security policies.\nExamples:\nOrganisation’s Intranet for its own users and systems.\nINFINET, a Closed User Group network governed and secured by RBI.\nEnhanced Trust Zone Characteristics:\nWhen applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines an enhanced set of security policies that users and systems in this Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. Typically, the users and systems are in a Closed User Group (CUG) with extended control and monitoring of their activities.\nWhen applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines an enhanced set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of highly secure VPNs and well-defined network security policies that are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider.\nIn general, the resource zones connected through an enhanced trust connectivity zone should themselves have enhanced trust.\nApplicable to:\nInternal users and systems of the organisation operating within Closed User Groups.\nUsers and systems of different Organizations connecting through trusted network, all of which are governed by a common set of enhanced security policies.\nExamples:\nOrganisation’s privileged users like system administrators managing the IT and OT resources.\nInternal LANs for high security operations, systems, and network administration.\nSome Government and Defence captive networks.\nHigh Trust Zone Characteristics:\nWhen applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a maximal set of security policies that users and systems in this Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. The organisation also specifies physical security and access controls for this zone and usually enforces network airgap for high security. All activities in this zone are monitored closely for any policy violation.\nWhen applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines an enhanced set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of highly secure VPNs and well-defined network security policies that are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider. Data diodes may be used for one-way communication from/to lower trust zones.\nIn general, the resource zones connected through a high trust connectivity zone should themselves have high trust and vice versa.\nApplicable to:\nInternal high security users and systems of the organisation operating within Closed User Groups.\nHigh security users and systems of different Organizations connecting through high trust network, all of which are governed by a common set of enhanced security policies.\nExamples:\nSome Government and Defence Organizations’ high security operations.\nHigh trust zones for ensuring the integrity and privacy of critical databases, such as Aadhaar demographic data, PKI infrastructure, HSMs etc.\nVery High Trust Zone Characteristics:\nWhen applied to a Resource Zone, the organisation defines a maximal set of security policies that users and systems in this Resource Zone should comply with to be permitted to operate within the Zone. The organisation also specifies physical security and access controls for this zone and always enforces network airgap for high security. All activities in this zone are monitored closely for any policy violation.\nWhen applied to a Connectivity Zone, the organisation defines a maximal set of security policies for the network that will be applied to users and systems while connecting through the Zone to other resource zones of the organisation. Typically, this would be in the form of custom hardware-based VPNs and detailed network security policies that are implemented and continuously verified for compliance either by the organisation or by a trusted network connectivity provider. Data diodes may be used for one-way communication from/to lower trust zones.\nIn general, the resource zones connected through a very high trust connectivity zone should themselves have very high trust and vice versa.\nApplicable to:\nInternal high security users and systems of the organisation operating within Closed User Groups.\nHigh security users and systems of different Organizations connecting through high trust network, all of which are governed by a common set of enhanced security policies.\nExamples:\nGovernment and Defence Organizations’ very high security operations.\nVery High trust zones for ensuring the integrity and privacy of extremely critical databases, such as Aadhaar biometric data, CCA and CA root certificates etc.\nUsing Trust Level Tags The trust levels can be applied to various tags so as to establish a common understanding between different teams and organisational hierarchies. Examples are given below.\nData Centre and OT Zones Zone Type Zone Description DC Zone HL5 Untrusted Resource Zone, Eg outside the external perimeter DC Zone HL4.5, HL3.5 Low Trust Resource Zone, Eg DMZ DC Zone HL4, HL3,\nOT Zone HL3 Standard Trust Resource Zone, hosting non-critical resources OT Zone HL2.5,\nIIoT Edge Zone HL1 Enhanced Trust Resource Zone, hosting critical operation and management resources OT Operations Zone HL2, HL1, HL0 High Trust Resource Zone, hosting critical OT supervisory and basic control systems and process systems that cannot be hardened to required extent Notes:\nData centre, remote/ branch office and cloud setups are typically segmented into multiple resource zones, each with its own trust level tag. Resource zones can be Operation zones or Management zones. Connectivity between DC zones is configured, secured \u0026 managed via DC networking infrastructure.\nColour tagged table of trust levels may be downloaded here.\nEnd User Zones Zone Type Zone Description End User UD, UC Public Users (both humans and machines) End User UB Other Organisation Users (both humans and machines) End User UA, OU Own Organisation Users (both humans and machines) End User UA, UB, OU Privileged Users (Administrators, Service Accts, Remote Support etc) both human \u0026 machine Notes:\nResources in User zones are typically configured, secured, and managed by the organisation/ user owning the resource (user account and/ or device).\nColour tagged table of trust levels may be downloaded here.\nConnectivity Zones Zone Type Zone Description Connectivity VD, XD Untrusted Connectivity Zone, Private owned, Public Internet Connectivity VC, XC Low Trust Connectivity Zone, Private owned, Extranet Connectivity VB, XB Standard Trust Connectivity Zone, GOE owned, Intranet, DC networking Connectivity VA, XA Enhanced Trust Connectivity Zone, Entity owned, Closed Group Network Notes:\nA connectivity zone is typically configured, secured, and managed by the network provider, data centre provider or, in some cases, by the organization.\nColour tagged table of trust levels may be downloaded here.\nPerimeter between Trust Zones Perimeter tags defined below are in the context of separation between trust zones (tagged with the higher trust zone)\nTag Tag Description PTL1 Ingress into/ egress from a low trust zone PTL2 Ingress into/ egress from a standard trust zone PTL3 Ingress into/ egress from an enhanced trust zone PTL4 Ingress into/ egress from a high trust zone PTL5 Ingress into/ egress from a very high trust zone It may be noted that Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) of entities should typically be in Resource zones with trust levels TL3, TL4 or TL5. Also, they should never be connected directly through a Connectivity Zone with trust level TL0.\nPerimeters between zones with different trust levels should implement security policies that are aligned with the required trust levels of the separated zones.\nColour tagged table of trust levels may be downloaded here.\nMapping Trust Levels to Government Classification The Ministry of Home Affairs has defined the following security classification tags:\nTop Secret: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security or national interest. This category is reserved for nation’s closest secrets and is to be used with great reserve. Secret: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security or national interest or cause serious embarrassment in its functioning. This classification should be used for highly important information and is the highest classification normally used. Confidential: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause damage to the security of the organisation or could be prejudicial to the interest of the organisation or could affect the organisation in its functioning. Most information, on proper analysis, will be classified no higher than confidential. Restricted: Information, which is essentially meant for official use only and which would not be published or communicated to anyone except for official purpose. Unclassified: Information that requires no protection against disclosure. e.g. public releases. Government organisations may want to establish a standardised mechanism to map classification tags to trust levels of resource and connectivity zones in government IT infrastructure. A sample mapping is illustrated below:\n# Zone Type Trust Level of Resource Zone Govt Data Classification 0 UD, NU Untrusted UNCLASSIFIED 1 UC, NU, HL4.5, HL3.5 Low Trust RESTRICTED 2 UB, NU, OU Standard Trust RESTRICTED 3 UA, NU, OU, L4, L3, L2, L1, L0 Enhanced Trust CONFIDENTIAL 4 UA, UB, SA, SB, OU High Trust SECRET 5 UA, SA, OU Very High Trust TOP SECRET # Zone Type Trust Level of Connectivity Zone Govt Data Classification 0 VC, VD, XD Untrusted UNCLASSIFIED 1 VC, VD, XC Low Trust RESTRICTED 2 VA, VB, VC, VD, XB Standard Trust RESTRICTED 3 VA, VB, VC, VD, XB Enhanced Trust CONFIDENTIAL 4 VA, VB, WA, XA, WA\nUse of Data Diode High Trust SECRET 5 VA, WA, XA, WA\nUse of Air Gap, Data Diode Very High Trust TOP SECRET https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/IIRA-v1.9.pdf ↩︎",

    "content": "Capability development is not a point in time activity. It must be sustained and improved throughout the life of an organisation. This requires mechanisms for continually monitoring and measuring the capability maturity of the organisation. A mature governance framework enables the leadership to set objectives, monitor performance, match performance with internal and external drivers and constraints to derive future projections.\nA capability maturity model typically comprises of a set of characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns that represent capability and progression in a particular discipline. Principally, the models must be able to provide insights to some of the concerns of CSEs and national bodies, as listed below:\nWhat are the maturity levels of CSEs in comparison with established benchmarks in governance, risk management, enterprise architectures, system lifecycle management, IT and infosec capabilities, technology implementations, operations and support processes, workforce characteristics?\nWhat must be improved?\nWhat needs to be measured and assessed to enable improvement?\nHow comprehensive are the enterprise policies, practices and processes?\nHow good is the visibility, oversight, and control across the enterprise on the compliance to policies?\nIn general, CMMs have the following characteristics:\ncollect the best practices.\nare developed by a collaboration of experts from diverse backgrounds.\nconsider the dispersion in size, knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience of organisations that use the model.\ntake a life cycle and continuous improvement approach.\nThere are prominent capability maturity models in the domains of cybersecurity and SOC operations, which are described below.\nCapability Maturity Modelling (CyberCMM) Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Modelling (CyberCMM) is globally acknowledged as a practical and successful approach to measure and improve the cyber resilience of enterprises. It helps organisations of all sectors, types, and sizes to evaluate and make improvements to their cybersecurity programs. It focuses on the implementation and management of cyber security practices associated with the information technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) assets and the environments in which they operate. A CyberCMM can:\nenable organisations to evaluate and benchmark their cybersecurity capabilities effectively and consistently and prioritize actions and investments to improve their cybersecurity capabilities.\nenable national bodies to share knowledge, best practices, and relevant references across organisations to help them improve their cybersecurity capabilities.\nenable national bodies to carry out data-driven analytics from sectoral, cross-sectoral and trends-over-time perspectives.\nCybersecurity capability maturity models are typically designed and engineered to provide a self- assessment platform for individual CSEs. National bodies are developing central systems that aggregate data from individual CSEs to carry out data-driven analytics from sectoral, cross-sectoral, and trends-over-time perspectives.\nUS DoE C2M2 The US energy industry led the development of C2M2 to help organisations in the energy sector to assess their cybersecurity maturity and make optimum investments towards that end. The model can also be used by other organisations, irrespective of their size and domain.\nThe target sectors that have leveraged C2M2 include energy, critical manufacturing, government, healthcare, defence industrial base and financial services.\nThe C2M2 leverages a set of proven cybersecurity practices, focusing on both IT and OT assets and environments. The C2M2 domains are:\nAsset Change \u0026 Configuration Management.\nThreat \u0026 Vulnerability Management.\nRisk Management.\nIdentity \u0026 Access Management.\nSituational Awareness.\nEvents and Incident Response.\nThird Party Risk Management.\nWorkforce Management.\nCybersecurity Architecture.\nCybersecurity Program Management. US DoD CMMC The model was developed for the Dept of Defense by Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (SEI-CMU) in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory with the intent to protect sensitive national security information and to protect the Defense Industrial Base from frequent and complex cyberattacks.\nThe intent of the framework is to assess and improve the overall cyber resilience of the Defence Industrial Base (DIB). The cybersecurity capabilities of DIB organisations can be rigorously measured using CMMC. This can be used by the DoD to make risk-informed decisions regarding the information it shares with DIB contractors. The CMMC thus helps the DOD in establishing levels of confidenece with regard to the security of defense contractors and the DIB.\nThe CMMC framework draws on maturity processes and cybersecurity best practices from multiple standards as well as input from DIB entities and the DoD. It is primarily designed to secure the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) supply chain. The DIB organisations have to be certified by a CMMC third-party assessment organisation (C3PAO) at a particular level prior to bidding on contracts.\nThe CMMC defines the following:\na practice is a specific technical activity or activities that are required and performed to achieve a specific level of cybersecurity maturity for a given capability in a domain.\na process is a specific procedural activity that is required and performed to achieve a maturity level.\nCMMC version 2.0 Dec 2021 defines 14 domains, three levels with practices for each level for the DIB, as under:\nLevel 1 – Foundational (level 1 of v1.0) - 17 practices 48 FAR 52-204-21 Oct 2016\nLevel 2 – Advanced (level 3 of v1.0) – mirrors NIST SP 800-171 (110 practices)\nLevel 3 – Expert (level 5 of v1.0) – based on subset of NIST SP 800-172.\nThe 14 domains are aligned with the families specified in NIST SP 800-171\nAccess Control (AC)\nAwareness \u0026 Training (AT)\nAudit \u0026 Accountability (AU)\nConfiguration Management (CM)\nIdentification \u0026 Authentication (IA)\nIncident Response (IR)\nMaintenance (MA)\nMedia Protection (MP)\nPersonnel Security (PS)\nPhysical Protection (PE)\nRisk Assessment (RA)\nSecurity Assessment (CA)\nSystem \u0026 Comn Protection (SC)\nSystem \u0026 Info Integrity (SI)\nAn organisation must meet both the process and practice level requirements to achieve that level of certification within CMMC.\nIEC 62443 Maturity Levels From an organisational perspective, the IEC 62443 standard series describes four “Maturity Level” ratings (ML 1 – ML 4). The ML rating system is used to evaluate how well an organisation defines and describes security processes and how well the processes are followed by the personnel involved. The maturity levels are distinct from security levels (SL-T).\nCERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM) The CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM), developed by the CERT Division of SEI, Carnegie Mellon University defines 26 processes areas grouped into 4 categories - Enterprise Management, Operations Management, Engineering and Process Management. The resilience strategy translates to evolving measures to protect and sustain the assets viz. people, information, technology and facilities.\nReBIT Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMM) The RBI Cyber Security Maturity Model (CMM) is developed in Oct 2017 as an industry initiative coordinated by ReBIT. The CMM is closely aligned with RBI-CSF, which is harmonious with international standards, such as NIST CSF, COBIT 5.0, ISO 27000 and other standards.\nRBI CMM focuses on i) implementation and adoption of the mandated cybersecurity framework uniformly in the financial firms, ii) understanding of the firm’s cybersecurity maturity in terms of the adoption of the regulatory cybersecurity framework, iii) benchmarking, and iv) regulatory tracking.\nThe CMM provides guidance through i) a methodical approach to measurement of risk, planning of controls and governance and security strategy execution to strengthen cybersecurity posture of financial firms, and ii) metrics-based treatment, benchmarking and prioritizing risk driven investment in security.\nSecure Controls Framework’s™ (SCF) SCF’s Cybersecurity \u0026 Data Privacy Capability Maturity Model (C|P-CMM) is an undertaking by SCF contributors to define maturity levels for the SCF’s control catalogue. The SCF leverages an existing framework, namely the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model v2.0 (SSE-CMM) and provides control-level criteria to an existing CMM model.\nSOC-CMM SOC-CMM, evolved from a research project to become a well-used standard for measuring capability maturity in Security Operations Centres. The SOC-CMM model was initially created to determine characteristics and features of SOCs, such as specific technologies or processes. It evolved to become the defacto standard for measuring capability maturity in Security Operations Centers.\nAt the core of the assessment tool lies the SOC-CMM model. This model consists of 5 domains and 26 aspects, that are each evaluated using a number of questions. The domains ‘Business’, ‘People’ and ‘Process’ are evaluated for maturity only (blue colour), the domains ‘Technology’ and ‘Services’ are evaluated for both maturity and capability (purple colour).\nMaturity SOC-CMM is a continuous maturity model, allowing improvements across all domains simultaneously and independently. The SOC-CMM uses maturity stages based loosely on the CMMI:\nNon-existent. At this level, the aspect is not present in the SOC\nInitial. The aspect is delivered in an ad-hoc fashion\nManaged. The aspect is documented and delivered consistently\nDefined. The aspect is managed using ad-hoc feedback on the quality and timeliness of deliverables\nQuantitatively Managed. The aspect is systematically being measured for quality, quantity and timeliness of deliverables\nOptimizing. The aspect is continuously being optimized and improved.\nCapability The SOC-CMM uses a continuous approach to measuring technical capability across the technology and services domains. These can be technical features, such as the existence of certain tooling options or other features such as service artefacts. Capabilities can be expressed at any maturity level. Just like with maturity scoring, capability scoring is continuous. Similar to the CMMI, the SOC-CMM supports 4 capability levels:\nIncomplete. The capability is missing or lacking essential features\nPerformed. The capability is performed, but not standardised\nDefined. The capability is deliverd in a standardised fashion\nManaged. The capability is active managed and improved.\nMethodology The methodology used to create the SOC-CMM is a scientific research approach called Design Science Research. This type of research has a focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice and works well for areas that have not been extensively (scientifically) studied and clearly defined, as is the case for SOC capability and maturity. The goal of Design Research is the creation of a tangible result of the research effort. In this case, two artefacts were created: the SOC-CMM model, which is an abstract representation of SOCs and the self-assessment tool based on that model to evaluate capability maturity in a SOC.\nThe SOC-CMM self-assessment tool is available for download here.",

    "content": "The NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for accreditation of IT and ICS Training Bodies (TBs) is an initiative of the Government to develop a pool of specialist organisations that can help CSEs in training their workforce to handle the different dimensions of work related to the digital ecosystem. The TBs can also offer training services to individual professionals, who are desirous of enhancing their competencies and obtaining certifications.\nThe core objective of the Scheme is to put in place a robust system of oversight and due diligence to accredit bonafide TBs, with an assurance that they can impart high quality training to the organisation’s workforce and individual professionals.\nAlignment with Domains Training offered by the TBs to CSEs and individuals are aligned to the 19 domains of the CSEs that are defined under the Scheme and tabulated below. This alignment will help the CSEs to easily map the training objectives and outcomes to their domain requirements.\n.

The details are given under the following heads:\nDomain Knowledge and Skill modules Number of days for training Training objectives Training outcomes Mode of delivery (online/ face-to-face/ hybrid) Readers are advised to consult the Scheme documents for further details.\nAccreditation of TBs Accreditation Bodies (AB) are responsible for accreditation of TBs under the Scheme. During the accreditation process, the TB shall be attested for their capability, competence and level of expertise to provide training service as per the detailed scope of work/ services tabulated in the Scheme document.\nThe accreditation process requires the TB to demonstrate to the AB that their trainers have the required competency (knowledge, skills and advanced/ master level expertise) to deliver the training. The Scheme tabulates the knowledge and skill requirements for the trainers, which is derived from the Scheme for Cybersecurity Professionals.\nThe evidence of competency is usually demonstrated through global certifications and documented work experience of the trainers.\nOnce accredited, the TB can offer their training services as a whole package or parts of it, depending on the scope chosen and the services sought by the client.\nGuidance CSEs must leverage the robust mechanism of the NCIIPC-QCI Scheme to accredit skilled training bodies. The CSEs can hire TBs to train their composite workforce to handle portions of the work of conceptualisation, design, engineering, acquisition, operation and management of their digital infrastructure.\nThe Scheme documentation will also be useful to the internal training teams of organsiations. They can use the structure and content to devise their training packages just like the accredited TBs.",

    "content": "NCIIPC-QCI Conformity Assessment Framework for Cybersecurity of CSEs The implementation, operation and management of cyber security in CSEs requires to be assessed by independent accredited Certification Bodies (CBs) and Inspection Bodies (IBs) for compliance with prescribed standards for the sectors. Further, the CSEs require competent cyber security professionals, who are assessed and certified by independent accredited Personnel Certification Bodies (PrCBs). The CSEs also require competent consultancy organisations (COs) and training bodies (TBs), whose expertise and competence is assessed and certified by independent Accreditation Bodies (ABs).\nNCIIPC and Quality Council of India (QCI) have formulated and designed a comprehensive Scheme for “Conformity Assessment Framework for Cybersecurity of Critical Sector Entities”. The objective of the Scheme is to establish robust cybersecurity accreditation, certification and inspection processes for\ncritical sector entities (CSEs) cybersecurity professionals consulting organisations (COs) training bodies (TBs) The Scheme incorporates the international framework for accreditation of conformity assessment bodies, viz, CBs, IBs and PrCBs, which is the most appropriate mechanism to ensure quality, integrity, consistency and standardisation.\nThe CAF for cyber security of CSEs comprises of the following Schemes:\nCertification Scheme for Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) at Levels 1,2 and 3. Inspection Scheme for Information Technology and Industrial Control Systems (IT/ICS). Personnel Certification Scheme for Cyber Security Professionals. Accreditation Scheme for IT/ICS Consultancy Organisations (COs). Accreditation Scheme for IT/ICS Training Bodies (TBs). Details of the Scheme are available on NCIIPC and QCI websites.\nThe outcomes delivered by the Schemes are as under:\nPool of accredited CBs \u0026 IBs: The Government, Regulators, NCIIPC, CSEs and other organisations will have a pool of accredited CBs and IBs for carrying out conformity assessment and/ or inspection of an organisation’s information infrastructure and information security/ cybersecurity management system (ISMS/ CSMS).\nPool of accredited PrCBs and certified Cyber Security Professionals: All organisations will have an indigenous pool of certified cybersecurity professionals, who are assessed and certified by accredited PrCBs for their competence (knowledge, skills, expertise) to implement and ensure IT and OT cyber resilience. The competency certification of cybersecurity professionals is closely aligned with the workforce competency described here.\nPool of accredited COs and TBs: All organisations will have an indigenous pool of accredited COs and TBs with independently certified expertise and competence, to provide them cybersecurity consultancy services and train their workforce. The COs and TBs themselves will leverage the established pool of CSPs for delivering their services.\nThe Scheme as a whole is adapted to the cybersecurity requirements of CSEs and other organisations of the Indian ecosystem. It is expected to contribute to building national capacity in the cybersecurity domain.\nGlobal Certifications An illustrative list of cybersecurity certifications offered by global certifying bodies has been compiled from publicly available information and is given below.

    "content": "Organisational governance is defined as “a system by which an organisation makes and implements decisions in pursuit of its objectives.” Organisational governance is achieved by a mix of standards, rules, processes, practices, and technology platforms that support maturity in governance.\nIn view of enhanced role of ICT for achieving the business mission and objectives, governance of IT and information security are considered as a subset or domain of organisational (entity) governance. Definitions of governance in specific context of IT and Information security are provided in ISO/IEC 26000, ISO/IEC 38500:20151 and ISO/IEC 27014:20202.\nGovernance of Enterprise IT (ISO/IEC 38500:2015) deals with resources required to acquire, process, store and disseminate information.\nEnterprise Information Security Governance (ISO/IEC 27014:2020) deals with assurance of information confidentiality, integrity and availability and effective communication of the same with various external stakeholders.\nGovernance of Enterprise IT A model for good governance of IT shall assist those at the highest level of the entities to understand and fulfil their legal, regulatory and other obligations in respect of their entity’s use of IT. Further it assists governing bodies to ensure that the use of IT contributes positively to the performance of the organisation. Governing bodies should exercise their authority to ensure that their organisations follow a well-defined and suitable model for governance of IT, based on global best practices, to ensure that the risks arising from the use of IT can be managed and opportunities can be exploited.\nISO/IEC 38500:2015 describes the principles and practices for good governance of IT and provides a baseline for each entity to develop their own model. The six core principles are:\nEstablish responsibility.\nDefine strategy for IT to support business.\nMake acquisitions as appropriate.\nEnsure performance.\nEnsure conformance.\nAchieve appropriate human behaviour.\nFurther, three main practices through which the governing bodies can continuously evolve governance of IT are:\nEvaluate the current and future use of IT in the context of the business need.\nDirect preparation and implementation of strategies and policies to ensure that use of IT meets business objectives.\nMonitor performance against the strategies particularly regarding their business objectives and conformance to external obligations and internal work practices.\nGovernance of Information Security Governance of information security ensure effective implementation of information security controls and provides the following assurance:\nDirectives concerning information security will be followed.\nThe governing body will receive reliable and relevant reports about information security related activities.\nThe framework for governance of information security will assist the governing body to make decisions concerning the strategic objectives for the organisation. It further provides information about information security that can affect these strategic objectives. It also ensures that information security strategy aligns with the overall objectives of the entity.\nISO/IEC 27014:2020 defines six objectives for information security governance that provide a baseline for overall direction and control by the governing bodies and the top management. The detailed description of each objective and process is given in the ISO document. The practical application of each objective within an entity is briefly described below:\n1. Establish integrated comprehensive entity-wide information security Objective 1 calls for the establishment of an integrated comprehensive entity-wide information security framework. In practice, this would generally be addressed as under:\nOrganisations should define and document an enterprise level context for their Information Security Management System (ISMS). Further, the context, scope, external elements etc. of each of their individual ISMS implementations (business-unit or site-based) should flow from and be fully aligned with the enterprise context.\nOrganisations should define and document an enterprise level ISMS objective and policy. The ISMS policies of each of the individual ISMS implementations should be aligned with the enterprise context.\nAn enterprise level approach would provide the following benefits:\nGoverning bodies and top management can evaluate, direct, and monitor that information security is consistent across the enterprise.\nRegulators and national nodal agencies can validate that the policy directives and regulatory guidelines provided to the regulated and critical sector entities are incorporated into the enterprise level ISMS framework, which further gets applied uniformly into all the ISMS implementations in the entities.\nAuditors can easily assess and verify whether all the mandated policies have been incorporated in each of the ISMSs audited by them.\n2. Make decisions using a risk-based approach Objective 2 calls for using a risk-based approach for decisions. A risk-based approach is recognised world-wide as an effective mechanism for inter-se prioritisation of the following:\nInvestment in protection functions that includes business continuity.\nAllocation and use of resources.\nWork related to tracking and monitoring functions.\nIncident response and crisis management activities.\nIn general, risk is a function of impact and likelihood. However, entities may decide that the potential impact of some of the disruptions are so devastating that they have the highest risk even if their likelihood is very low. In all other cases, risk reflects the organisation’s ability to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfil its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Regulated and critical sector entities would benefit from using the ISO, IEC, NIST and other well-known standards to design, develop and implement risk management system within their organisations. A risk-based approach helps entities correctly identify all the controls that are applicable in their ISMSs. An enterprise level approach to risk management would provide the following benefits:\nGoverning bodies and top management can evaluate the information security risks with the use of IT to achieve business objectives and further incorporate them into the enterprise level ISMS framework. This will help them direct and monitor the individual ISMSs effectively.\nRegulators and national nodal agencies can validate that all the additional controls prescribed by them are consolidated into the enterprise level ISMS framework, which further gets applied uniformly into all the ISMS implementations in the entities.\nCybersecurity auditors can use the comprehensively defined Statement of Applicability (SoA) to verify that all risks have been considered for their technical audit.\n3. Set the direction of acquisition Objective 3 calls for setting the direction of acquisition of IT, OT, and Information Security capabilities in a comprehensive and consistent manner.\nThe enterprise level risk assessment carried out as part of Objective 2 will help in the prioritisation of investments and allocation of resources. The Information Security Steering Committees (ISSC) of critical sector entities can provide right guidance to the top management when there is a common understanding of risk.\n4. Ensure conformance with internal and external requirements. Objective 4 calls for ensuring conformance with internal and external requirements.\nOne of the objectives of regulators and national bodies is to standardise information security management and its audit across various entities, particularly the critical sector entities. A common approach and methodology of audit of IT Security can be achieved through the guidelines given in various national / international standards.\nEntities should evaluate and adopt an internationally accepted methodology for audit of the implemented IT and Information Security Management System at agreed frequency and scope (this frequency and scope should be compliant with the minimum baseline promulgated vide various rules and regulations). The audit scope, audit objective, audit criteria and the competency of the auditors should be such that it provides adequate assurance to the stakeholders on the objectivity and impartiality of the results. The results of the audit are to be reviewed at an appropriate level in the entity / controller / regulator. The causal analysis and corrective action plan for any non-conformities observed in the audit are also to be reviewed and tracked for acceptable closure.\n5. Foster a security-positive culture Objective 5 calls for fostering a security-positive culture, which is largely a people-driven activity. This requires the top management to focus on building a positive information security culture within the entity through security education, training and awareness programs and integrating the information security responsibilities into the roles of employees and managers.\n6. Ensure the security performance meets current and future requirements of the entity Objective 6 calls for ensuring that the security performance meets current and future requirements of the entity.\nA data-driven analytical approach for security performance monitoring and measurement would be highly beneficial for entities. This approach requires entities to identify and use software applications and automation platforms for data acquisition, evidence collection and analysis of both IT and information security performance. The acquired measurement data would help the internal, external, and special audit teams to review and assess the information security processes and activities.\nNational nodal agencies can further evolve platforms and processes for machine-processing of data from different entities to carry out sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis of audit compliance, audit effectiveness and grading of auditors. The governing bodies and the top management may apply following four main processes repetitively to achieve the above objectives:\nEvaluate\nDirect\nMonitor\nCommunicate\nEssential Top Level Management Governance Functions The key processes for governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security are depicted in the pictorial below.\nA harmonised view of the governance functions are covered here.\nSummary The governance frameworks provide the core principles, objectives and processes in IT and Information Security for the governing bodies and top management to implement effective governance in their respective business context. The focus of governance of IT is on managing resources to acquire, process, store and disseminate information (this may include OT and IIoT). This functionality is complemented by the governance of Information Security, which focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (including the safety of OT and IIoT).\nThe governing bodies and top management of all regulated and critical sector entities are accountable for the Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security. They have the responsibility to evaluate and direct the specific actions required to implement the principles within their organisations and monitor their efficacy. In short, Governance of Enterprise IT and Information Security are board-level agendas.\nCommunication is an important Information Security governance process since it enables entities to be held accountable to interested parties. As part of this function, the critical sector entities must maintain continuous information flow with the national nodal agencies and the sectoral regulators. This communication is necessary for the national nodal agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of their risk management and information security management. The entities are also required by law to report information security incidents to appropriate national nodal agencies and regulators, as applicable.\nAssurance aspect is overseen by the sectoral regulators and the national nodal agencies bodies, who exercise their authority to audit the regulated and critical sector entities for compliance to law, regulation and directives issued by them.\nIt is also important to recognise that, while the authority for specific aspects of IT and Information Security may be delegated to managers within the organisations, the accountability for effective, efficient, and acceptable use of IT and Information Security within the entity and all its organisations remains with the governing body and top management in case of CSEs. This responsibility and accountability cannot be delegated.\nThe governance of enterprise IT and information security in the internal context (within the jurisdiction of the entity) is fairly straightforward. All entities typically implement their IT, OT and IS infrastructure to align with their business functions. The operational structure is usually in the form of business units, departments, sites/ branches, and locations. The organisational structure is closely aligned with the operational structure in the form of a governing body or board, top or executive management, senior, middle-level, and lower-level management.\nhttps://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:38500:ed-2:v1:en ↩︎\nhttps://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:27014:ed-2:v1:en ↩︎",

    "content": "ISMS Design, Implementation and Operation Overview and Purpose All organisations recognise the need to protect their business functions, capabilities and processes from being disrupted or compromised. It requires the resilience to be built into the governance, business, technology and physical levels. Organisations use mechanisms like information security management systems (ISMS), incident response (IR), business continuity management systems (BCMS) and cyber crisis management plans (CCMP) to implement and manage the required resilience.\nInformation Security Management System (ISMS) is a generic term to describe the practice of protecting an organisation’s business functions from disruptions and compromise, and to ensure compliance to laws and regulation. Critical sector entities with notified CII/ Protected Systems are mandated under IT (NCIIPC) Rules, 2018, to setup and operate an ISMS in their organisations.\nAll the business functions and processes run on an underlying information infrastructure. An ISMS can assure the resilience of an organisation’s information infrastructure.\nOrganisations have an option to design, implement and operate their own custom-built ISMS. However, most organisations implement their ISMS based on published standards like IS/ISO/IEC 27001 or QCI CSMS Level 1. The latter option gives them the benefit of independent third-party certification by an accredited Certification Body (CB).\nTip It is advisable for an organisation to start its ISMS journey with a custom-designed, standards-agnostic ISMS. This approach will trigger a deep application of mind on the governance, business and technical objectives and the desired outcomes from the ISMS without being constrained by any specific framework. If required, Section 4 of ISO 27003 can be used for basic guidance and direction. Once the standards-agnostic ISMS design is accepted by the governing body and the top management, the ISMS implementation team can work on using an appropriate standard for implementation.\nInformation Security Management Systems (ISMS) design, implementation and operation refers to the approach that organisations must adopt to protect their IT, OT and IIoT information infrastructure and keep them resilient against cyberattacks. The practice involves identifying risks to the information infrastructure of the organisation, designing policies and controls to mitigate and manage these risks, and implementing the same within the organisation.\nA crucial part of this practice is about regular reviews and updates to keep up with evolving security threats. Consistent review and improvement of an organisation’s ISMS practice not only secures the information infrastructure but also supports the organisations’ regulatory compliance and business continuity.\nISMS Governance Governing bodies and top management of entities must direct the ISMS to be based on organisational reqirements and have an entity-wide perspective. They have the responsibility to evaluate the requirement of one or more ISMSs to support the information security objectives of the entity. Section 5 of ISO 27003 provides guidance for leadership functions. Section 6 of ISO 27003 and ISO 27005 provide guidance for risk related functions. Section 7 of ISO 27003 provides guidance on providing resources for implementation and operation of ISMS.\nThe governing body should undertake the following with due diligence for the success of ISMS:\nMandatorily define and document an enterprise-level context for ISMS in their organisations.\nApprove the creation of ISMS.\nMandatorily define and document an enterprise-level ISMS objective and policy. It should provide directions to each ISMS implementation in the organisation to align it with the enterprise context.\nAll policy and regulatory directions received from and national nodal bodies and the regulators should be incorporated into the enterprise-level ISMS policy. This will help auditors assess whether all the policies have been incorporated.\nTake decisions on acceptable levels of residual risk or appropriate risk treatments.\nProvide each ISMS with communication channels and authority to inform interested parties and all persons in the scope of that ISMS.\nPlans to obtain ISMS certifications must be formulated at the enterprise level. Obtaining certifications for individual sites, without having an entity-wide plan will be inefficient and ineffective because the individual ISMSs would not be aligned with the entity’s information security objectives, policies and processes and risk management.\nThe governing bodies and top management of entities must also monitor the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS during the operational stage to keep it aligned with the organisation’s objectives.\nConformance to Standards ISMS based on ISO 27001:2022 or NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme offer significant benefits in terms of documentation and guidance. The ISO 27000 series documents provide comprehensive information for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving an ISMS. These documents can also be used for establishing an ISMS even when an organisation does not want the ISO certification.\nNote The NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme encompasses ISO 27001 certification.\nISO 27000 Series ISO 27001 ISMS Requirements - Details the actual requirements for organizations to comply with the ISO 27000 standards. ISO 27002 ISMS controls - Builds on ISO 27001 by providing a description of the various controls that can be utilized to meet the requirements of ISO 27001. ISO 27003 Guidelines for implementing an ISMS involve securing project approval, defining scope, conducting analysis and risk assessment, and designing the ISMS framework. ISO 27004 ISMS Measurements - Outlines how an organization can monitor and measure security in relation to the ISO 27000 standards with metrics. ISO 27005 Risk Management - Defines the high-level risk management approach. ISO 27006 Guidelines for ISO 27000 accreditation bodies - Outlines the requirements for organizations that will measure ISO 27000 compliance for certification. Tip ISMS practitioners should study the ISO 27000 series documents listed above and adopt them in a suitable manner into the ISMS design, implementation and operation.\nISMS Design Some of the activities and tasks associated with ISMS design are given below:\nScope Determination: Define the ISMS scope, ensuring it encompasses all assets, people, processes, and IT systems. The ISMS design and implementation team must understand the business functions and processes of the organisation and their interdependencies. Policy Development: Design comprehensive security policies that address the protection of information assets against various threats and establish security objectives. Roles Definition: Assign clear information security roles and responsibilities, ensuring accountability and proper oversight of the ISMS initiatives. Risk Management: Find, assess, and handle risks according to the set standards. Control Selection: Choose appropriate security controls from the relevant frameworks to mitigate identified risks. Control Implementation: Deploy security measures and practices in alignment with the established ISMS policy framework, supporting the organisation’s security strategy. Automation: Evaluate and select software applications and platforms for operating and managing the ISMS processes (documentation, risk, SoA mapping, evidence collection, compliance tracking etc). Employee Training and Awareness: Combine regular security awareness programs with skill enhancement training to educate employees about ISMS policies and improve their ability to contribute to the organisation’s security. Continuous Monitoring: Oversee the ongoing effectiveness of the ISMS and security controls, adapting to new threats and organisational changes. Regular Audits: Implement a schedule of internal and external audits to ensure continuous compliance with ISMS requirements and identify opportunities for improvement. Improvement Actions: Address non-conformities and areas of weakness identified during reviews and audits, closing gaps in the ISMS where necessary. ISMS Implementation Each ISMS must implement controls for information security risk treatment in accordance with the policies approved by the governing board / top management of the CSE. ISO 27003 provides explanation and guidance for implementing all requirements of ISO 27001.\nGeneric steps for implementing ISMS based on ISO 27001:2022 or NCIIPC-QCI Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) Level 1 Scheme are given below:\nSet the scope of ISMS by defining what parts of the organisation’s information systems are intended to be protected. The scope typically includes the organisation’s business processes and locations that will be covered under ISMS. Establish and publish a top-level Information Security policy for the organisation. This will be further supported by subordinate policies. Set the Risk Assessment context as per the requirements stated in Clause 4 to Clause 10 of ISO 27001:2022. Use ISO 27005 and various other guidelines for risk assessment. Identify and evaluate risk as per Clause 6 and Clause 8 of ISO 27001:2022. Establish a Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC) for the organisation, which should be approved by the top management of the organisation (Board or Board equivalent). The RAC will then be used as the basis for risk management (assessment, evaluation, and treatment). Set the risk acceptance threshold, based on the context of the organisation and the expectations of internal and external interested parties. Formulate the risk treatment plan in respect of the RAC by selecting appropriate controls from “Annex A of ISO 27001:2022”. Add supplementary and technical controls from external sources (e.g. guidelines and directives from Ministries, Regulators, NCIIPC, CERT-In, NSCS) and global good practices (e.g. PCI, CIS, Cloud Security Alliance) if they are considered necessary or suitable in the business context of the organisation. Use ISO 27002:2022 as a working guideline for meeting the requirements of ISO 27001:2022. Document all the applicable controls along with their point of application in a Statement of Applicability (SoA) document. Any control, if excluded, should be justified in the SoA and the same should also comply with the risk acceptance criteria. Implement the security controls given in the SoA on the information infrastructure. Typically, two-tier control deployment, viz primary control and supervisory control is adopted to mitigate the critical risks. Carry out an audit or inspection of the information infrastructure through CERT-In empanelled auditors, covering both process and technical deployment of controls, as per the guidelines issued by CERT-In and NSCS. Test the effectiveness of implementation and operation of cyber security technical controls through the mechanism of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VA \u0026 PT) ISMS flowchart is pictorially represented below.\nISMS Operation Organisations should adopt appropriate methods to continuously operate and evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS after its implementation and Go-Live. Reporting to the governing body and top management is essential to the success of ISMS.\nIS/ISO/IEC TS 27008:2019 provides guidance on reviewing and assessing the implementation and operation of information security controls. It includes the technical assessment of information system controls and their compliance to criteria established by the organisation, law and regulation.\nAnother critical aspect of ISMS operation is to measure the outcomes delivered by it. ISO/IEC 27004 provides detailed guidelines for evaluating the information security performance and the effectiveness of an ISMS.\nISO/IEC 27001:2022, Clause 9.1 requires the organisation to evaluate the information security performance and the effectiveness of the ISMS. It requires the organisation to determine:\nwhat needs to be monitored and measured (systems, processes and activities). the methods for monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation. when the monitoring and measuring shall be performed. who shall monitor and measure. when the results from monitoring and measurement shall be analysed and evaluated. who shall analyse and evaluate these results. The ISMS operation must generate output for various attributes of the implemented controls that can be used to measure the efficacy of the controls, such as:\nthe degree to which a control reduces the likelihood of the occurrence of an event. the degree to which a control reduces the consequence of an event. the frequency of events that a control can cope with before failure. how long after the occurrence of an event does it take for the control to detect that the event has occurred. Measurable data from systems and processes is generated continuously in the form of event logs, metrics, traces and audit trails. These measures must be collected and analysed as frequently as possible. However, the reporting of such measures may be scheduled as per the needs of the interested parties.\nFor example, while data on security incidents is collected continually, internal reporting to higher levels of management will depend on the defined polices, such as severity (possibly requiring immediate notification as in the case of a reportable breach) or aggregated values (as might be the case for attempted intrusions which were detected and blocked). Similarly, reporting of cybersecurity incidents to external interested parties like regulators, CERT-In, sectoral CERTs and NCIIPC, will be based on their respective directives.\nISO/IEC 27001:2022 also requires the organisation to retain appropriate documented information as evidence of the monitoring and measurement results.\nMetrics Some of the possible metrics for continual improvement of ISMS are listed below.\nKey Performance Indicators Description Number of Security Incidents Count of unwanted events that could endanger the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information. Security Control Audit and Review Frequency Measures the number of times security controls are reviewed and audited. Audit Findings The number of critical findings or unresolved issues from audits. Delay in Scheduled Audits Measures the percentage of scheduled audits and reviews that are not completed within their planned timeframes. Number of Non-Compliance Issues Track the number of identified non-compliance issues during the audit with legal and regulatory requirements Effectiveness of Security Controls Tracks the percentage of risks successfully prevented, detected, and mitigated. How well security measures prevent, detect, and mitigate risks Policy Implementation Coverage The percentage of critical assets covered by security policies. Number of outdated Policies Number of policies that are not updated to reflect current threats. Number of Improvements Identified Measures the number of policies, processes or controls identified for improvement during ISMS activities or audits. Number of Non-Conformities Identified Measures the number of occasions on which the ISMS fails to meet the specified ISO 27001 requirements. Percentage of Assets Covered under ISMS Measures the proportion of the organization’s assets - people, processes, technology - that are protected by the implemented ISMS. Frequency of ISMS Review Tracks the number of ISMS being reviewed and updated. Employee Training Completion Rates Numbers of employees that have completed security awareness and training programs. Security Awareness Level Measures the percentage of employees understanding security protocols. Leveraging Automation Given the scale and complexity of modern information infrastructures, automation is essential for monitoring the use and effectiveness of controls. There are many software platforms that can monitor the ISMS activities and generate reports for various levels of management. The software platforms also provide a record of ISMS activities that the audit teams can use as evidence. Work is also being done to create human and machine-readable formats such as the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) for automated management of ISMS controls.\nPeriodic inspection and audit of ISMS of CSEs is a time-consuming activity. The regulators and national bodies can also create platforms and processes for machine-processing of ISMS data from the CSEs, which will also help in sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis of audit compliance and non-compliance issues, audit effectiveness, grading of auditors etc.\nISMS Practice Owners A sample matrix of responsibilities is given below.\nActivity Primary Ownership Collaborative Role Establish and review the ISMS strategy. ISSC Information Security Team Oversee the development of ISMS policies and procedures. CISO Information Security Team Maintain the ISMS documentation and control mechanisms. Information Security Team - Ensure ISMS compliance with legal and regulatory standards. GRC Team Legal Team Implement controls, standards and guidelines emanating from the ISMS implementation and design programme. IT/OT Ops Team - Conduct ISMS awareness and training programs. HR Team Information Security Team Monitor and report on ISMS performance using KPIs/KRIs. GRC Team IT/OT Ops Team Manage ISMS auditing and continual improvement. Internal/External Audit Team Information Security Team NCIIPC Guidelines Important These guidelines are taken from NCIIPC’s documentation of Nov 2024. CSEs must consult NCIIPC for the latest updates and further guidance.\nGovernance CSE shall design, develop, approve, and implement ISMS as part of the Information Security Policy to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation’s information assets. CSE shall establish an Information Security Steering Committee responsible for providing direction, approving policies, and monitoring the ISMS effectiveness. CSE shall describe and assign information security roles and responsibilities based on the organization’s requirements. CSE shall appoint a senior management representative as the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to oversee the ISMS design, implementation, operation, and maintenance. CSE shall ensure that all individuals working in the organisation are aware of: the information security policy their part in improving the security system. the consequences of not following security policies CSEs shall establish clear channels for all information security related communications. CSE shall conduct reviews of the ISMS to ensure the effectiveness of the organization’s approach to managing cybersecurity and its implementation, at planned intervals or when significant changes occur. All employees shall be provided with information security awareness training and be held accountable for adhering to security policies and procedures. CSE should monitor the defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the ISMS design, implementation and operation. Technical CSEs shall develop and implement an ISMS policy framework that includes related information security policies, procedures, and standards. While developing the ISMS, the CSE shall consider relevant factors, identify risks and opportunities, and focus on preventative measures and continuous improvement. CSE shall implement appropriate security controls based on identified risks, in alignment with ISO 27001 Annex A controls as well as other controls prescribed by regulators and nodal agencies. CSE shall maintain a Statement of Applicability (SoA) defining the controls applicable to the organisation. CSE shall identify and control external documents deemed necessary for the planning and operation of its information security management system. CSE shall review the ISMS design and implementation process at regular intervals and implement changes. CSE shall utilize appropriate technological, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect information assets. CSE shall ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding information security and data privacy. CSE shall maintain a business continuity and disaster recovery plan to minimize disruption in the event of an incident. CSE shall design and execute an audit programme to assess the ISMS. This programme shall have a systematic approach and prioritise processes based on their significance and findings from previous audits. The auditing exercise shall provide documented information to verify the execution and effectiveness of the ISMS. ISMS for Regulators Besides the CSEs, the regulatory bodies would also benefit from establishing an ISMS, based on recognised standards. The ISMS would specifically help the regulators to:\nControl the collection, processing, distribution, and retention, of sensitive information to be processed by them for effective regulation in the sector. Understand the requirements of the ISMS established and audit the regulated entities on adherence to the requirements. Issue sector-specific requirements, guidelines, checklists, to address the variations and constraints relevant to the local processing requirements. Adopt audit tools and analysis engines, designed to standard requirements, for evaluation of the information security performance in the regulated entities. ISMS for Agencies directing CSEs Agencies directing and controlling the operations in the critical sector have a responsibility to lead the way. The controlling agency typically review the functioning of the CSEs and, if policies exist that hinder the achievement of business objectives, these policies are identified and reported for improvement. Such agencies will therefore have sensitive data of the critical sectors. It is therefore recommended that the agencies also implement an ISMS to protect the information being processed at various levels within the agencies. Establishment of an ISMS will help the agencies to:\nControl the collection, processing, distribution, and retention, of sensitive information to be processed by them for effective governance in the sector. Understand the requirements of the ISMS established, and issue relevant directions to the controlled entities, and supply-chain, on adherence to the requirements. Establish a centrally managed framework to identify, analyse, evaluate, and treat the information security risks prevalent in the sector. Get trust, recognition, and support from other stakeholders for information security governance in the sector. Respond to emerging information security threats and trends by centrally managing the information security incidents in the sector. Easily migrate to any upgrades and improvements in information security governance, based on international and industry best practices.",

    "content": "The acquisition of capabilities to enable and support business needs is an important activity within organisations and also in the larger ecosystem. This section focuses on information and guidance related to acquisition of business and technology capabilities by the stakeholders.\nThe audience for this section includes:\nBusiness Unit heads, CIOs, CISOs. Technology strategy and perspective planning team. Project management and procurement teams. Technical implementation teams. OEMs and System Integrators (SI), service and support providers, consultancy organisations, inspection and audit bodies. Overview All capabilities are acquired through project or incremental procurement based approach, using capital or revenue budgets. Business and technology capabilities typically have two major lifecycle stages:\nAcquire and Provision. Operate and Maintain. The Acquire and Provision stage has a shorter lifespan of a few months, as compared to the Operate and Maintain stage, which typically extends into a few years for IT or tens of years for OT. A “Go-Live” event typically separates the two stages.\nGovernment, public sector entities and large enterprises have two broad frameworks for acquisition of capabilities, namely, Detailed Project Reports (DPR) and Request for Proposal (RFP).\nThe DPR framework is used when the requirement is for large scale and complex use of IT for transformation of business functions. RFPs are more focused and are typically used for incremental improvement of business functions using IT.\nTechnology Strategy and Perspective Planning A study of various DPRs indicate that they reflect the strategic direction of the organisations in the use of IT and cover a period of 7 to 10 years. However, each DPR is usually treated as a standalone document and the strategic thinking recorded in one DPR is not fully carried into other DPRs.\nEntities may consider the development of a common “Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning (TS\u0026PP)” document that captures the entity-wide strategic use of technology by the organisation. All DPRs and RFPs must then be aligned with the TS\u0026PP document.\nThe following aspects of strategic direction that is typically recorded in the DPRs, may be moved into the TS\u0026PP document:\nMission, functions, business capabilities and business processes of the organisation. External context – other organisations with whom governance, business and IT-driven interactions are carried out. This should also include the likely sources of threats and liabilities created by the external partners. Internal context – organisational hierarchy and structure, sites and locations, line, staff and functional units, roles and responsibilities of departments and key personnel. Current state of use of IT and information security to support the business functions. Expectations from the use of IT in terms of enhancement of capabilities, efficiency, and effectiveness in carrying out the business functions. Expected or desired future state of use of IT and information security. Some examples of strategic directions regarding the use of IT are given below:\nSelection of data centre and cloud service providers: owned by the organisation. provided by a government-owned or public sector entity. provided by a private entity with India-based data centres. multi-country-based data centres. Models of cloud deployment: IaaS PaaS SaaS XaaS Data access concerns: data access is required only for India based users and systems. data access is required for users and systems located outside India. Data localisation concerns: data can reside in any country. data can reside in any country, but one copy must reside in India for accessibility to regulatory and legal authorities. data must reside within India only and not move out of Indian jurisdiction. Models of workforce supply chain: entity’s own employees. contracted employees hired from manpower provider entities. outsourced work to service providers using their own employees. Data classification and handling methodologies for data that is created, stored, and shared in electronic form.\nInformation Security Assurance and ISMS:\nentities to have a trusted mechanism of internal and external audits, undertaken and reported by competent independent auditors. the audit scope, audit objectives, and audit criteria to be defined by the entity in consultation and direction of the concerned controlling / regulating body. the audit methodologies adopted to be in accordance with internationally accepted practices. the competency of the auditors to be ensured and ascertained through recognised trainings and evaluation criteria. Information security capabilities to enable smart, resilient, and sustainable digital ecosystem.\nSystems and security engineering lifecycle approaches.\nTechnologies, practices, and operating processes.\nEnterprise Architecture Organisations acquire off-the-shelf, custom-developed or SaaS-based business systems like ERP, CRM etc, to automate the business and industrial processes that deliver their business needs. The business systems run on underlying technology systems, which may be off-the-shelf, custom-built or in the cloud.\nA well-defined and well-designed architecture is crucial for the long-term resilience of an organisation’s business and technology systems. The mandatory governance, risk, compliance, and audit requirements prescribed by the regulators and nodal bodies are best achieved when they are embedded into the enterprise business and technology architectures of the entities.\nThe Enterprise Architecture Framework provides common information and guidance to create good architecture documents for use by various stakeholders responsible for design, engineering, implementation, maintenance and incremental enhancements of systems.\nEnterprise architects are the best people to create the business and technology architectures. The Technology Strategy and Perspective Planning Group may be assigned responsibility for its creation, periodic review and update. The group should also advise the advise the top management on providing the required strategic direction. Once accepted by the top management, the architecture can be used as a common base framework in DPRs and RFPs.\nOntology of Tags Entities use a wide variety of methods to depict and describe their enterprise business and technology architectures. However, there is no commonality on this aspect amongst the CSEs of different sectors.\nThe ontology of tags provides a common mechanism for business and technical managers to express distinct characteristics or features of various architectural elements. The common ontology helps different stakeholders to evaluate the impact, risk, compliance, governance, security, monitoring, and oversight aspects of the architecture elements. A combined view of all the evaluations can help the top management to decide and direct the most appropriate use of IT and prioritisation for investments.\nThe business and technology operation levels of the entity hierarchy can further use the ontology of tags to evaluate, decide, design, procure, implement, deploy, operate, manage, support, and monitor the digital ecosystem resources over their operating lifecycle.\nThe common ontology also helps the Government ministries, regulators, and national nodal bodies to focus their policies, regulations, oversight, and monitoring mechanisms on the vital components of the enterprise architecture.\nImportant Entities typically do not adopt the best practice of creating baseline record of key security architectural decisions and security configurations of systems at Go-Live stage. It is usually left to the SI and OEMs to keep such records.\nThese records are vital during the operations stage to discover the changes to architecture and configurations, some of which may have been triggered by malicious activities.\nTop management and external oversight bodies must insist that such records are maintained by the project management teams and the teams managing the business and technology systems.",

    "content": "The engineering aspects describe “how” ICT and cyber resilience capabilities can be implemented by proper conceptualisation and execution of IT and OT projects as well as through incremental engineering improvements during a project’s operating lifecycle. It delves into systems engineering and systems security engineering in IT, OT and IIoT systems. It also delves into cyber resiliency engineering, an emerging specialty system engineering discipline to develop survivable, trustworthy secure systems.\nThe audience for this chapter includes:\nBusiness Heads, CIOs, CTOs, CISOs and their respective teams within CSEs. Sectoral Regulators, who are mandated to oversee/ regulate the cybersecurity related issues of their regulated entities. Consultancy organisations, System Integrators, OEMs and MSPs/ MSSPs engaged by the CSEs. Empaneled bodies, who carry out cyber security verification \u0026 validation (V\u0026V), VAPT and technical audit of systems and networks of CSEs. the lower levels of management, who are responsible for project execution and maintenance of systems in the operations phase. project design and implementation teams, who conceptualise, design and implement the ICT and cyber security elements for protection of their IT, OT and IIoT. engineering support teams, who support the operations teams during the use of ICT, OT and IIoT. An engineering lifecycle approach is essential for successful delivery of business and technology systems. Readers may refer to relevant material included in the standards section of this document.\nEngineering requires the knowledge of concepts and technologies related to the use of IT and information security. The resources section provides links to well-known public documents.\nSystems Engineering It is globally recognised that large and complex IT and OT systems need to be engineered and secured using a life cycle approach. The design and engineering teams are expected to apply the knowledge, concepts, and principles from international work on systems engineering. The publications cover the principles and processes of systems engineering and systems security engineering, connecting the governance, program management, technology (systems) and operations layers within enterprises.\nSystems and software engineering lays the groundwork for a disciplined and organised approach towards building reliable, trustworthy secure systems. It is a collection of system life cycle technical and nontechnical processes with associated activities and tasks. The technical processes apply engineering analysis and design principles to deliver a system with the capability to satisfy stakeholder requirements and critical quality properties. The nontechnical processes provide engineering management of all aspects of the engineering project, agreements between parties involved in the engineering project, and project-enabling support to facilitate execution of the engineering project.\nSystems Security Engineering The systems security engineering discipline is applicable at each stage of the system life cycle and provides security considerations towards the engineering of systems. The system security engineering processes are designed to address cybersecurity aspects in IT, OT and IS projects. These processes are typically carried out by design and engineering teams during the project implementation phase, and by field engineering teams during the operations phase.\nSystems security engineering ensures that stakeholder protection requirements, and security issues associated with the system are accurately recognized and addressed in all systems engineering tasks throughout the system life cycle.\nAn organisation adopting systems security engineering lifecycle approach will be able to incorporate security by design and engineering during all the lifecycle stages of IT and OT systems, right from conceptualisation to design, procurement, installation, commissioning, acceptance, operations, and retirement.\nCyber Resiliency Engineering Cyber resiliency engineering is an evolving specialised discipline within system engineering, employed together with systems security engineering and resilience engineering to develop systems that are secure, dependable, and capable of withstanding threats. This is predicated on the assumption that adversaries will breach defences and establish a long-term presence in organisational systems. Hence, the focus should be on assuring the continuity of mission or business functions and reducing the risk of potentially compromised cyber resources.\nGuidance on Systems and Security Engineering Currently, implementing cybersecurity in large and complex systems is generally a bolt-on activity. The conventional VAPT carried out prior to acceptance of systems happens shortly before the system is put into production. At this stage, the time pressure typically impacts the level of testing of the robustness of security of the system.\nThe systems security engineering approach must be incorporated in every stage of the system cycle, covering both business systems and technology systems. This will ensure that the security architecture is of high quality and is based on the rigour with which the fundamental security design principles have been applied in the system lifecycle.\nThe following aspects must be considered while acquiring any new software/ application:\ncomplete cybersecurity life cycle support for the software system. appying the principles of Dev-Sec-Ops in the custom-development of software applications. mechanisms for software enhancements and bug fixing activities to avoid adverse impact of software weaknesses and vulnerabilties. skillsets required (in-house or through support services) for secure operations of the acquired system. carrying out VAPT and all vulnerabilities removed/ patched before any system goes live. accountability of OEMs and suppliers to follow the Information Security Engineering Lifecycle approach in the manufacturing/ assembly/ development of their products. non-acceptance of products/ solutions which have not followed the system security and cyber resiliency engineering best practices in the product development and in providing maintenance support services. Senior management, business heads, operations and support teams must develop in-house expertise or hire experts to help adopt systems security engineering lifecycle approach within their enterprise projects, starting with securing their CII.",

    "content": "The operations aspect focuses on “how” ICT and cyber resilience capabilities can be achieved during the operation phase of business and technology systems, through well-designed operating processes enabled by technology and tools, and by a workforce that is adequately trained on the processes and tools.\nThe audience for this chapter includes:\nBusiness Heads, CIOs, CTOs, CISOs and their respective teams within CSEs. Sectoral Regulators, who are mandated to oversee/regulate the cyber security related issues of their regulated entities. Consultancy Organisations, System Integrators, OEMs and MSPs/ MSSPs engaged by the CSEs. Empaneled Organiszations to carry out cyber security verification \u0026 validation (V\u0026V), VAPT and technical audit of systems and networks of CSEs. the lower levels of management, who are responsible for day-to-day business and technology operations. process design teams, who conceptualise and design ICT and cyber security operating processes for day to day use and for protection of ICT, OT and IIoT. operations teams, who implement and execute the day to day business and technology operating processes. workforce development teams, who train and enable the workforce to absorb and adopt technology and the day to day operating processes designed for achieving business and cyber resilience. Operations and Management Practices There is an intrinsic association and a high degree of interdependence between the practices of IT Operations (IT-Ops), IT Operations Management (ITOM), AI-driven operations (AI-Ops), site reliability engineering (SRE), information security operations (IS-Ops), Dev-Sec-Ops and CI/CD pipeline activities.\nAt the macro level all operating and management practices have a generic purpose to help improve visibility, observability, compliance, control, responsiveness, and reporting within the critical sector entities themselves, as well as in the larger federated digital ecosystem.\nAt a granular level, the execution steps of operating and management processes would be sector/ entity and context specific, depending on generic and sector/ entity-specific factors. These factors include the entity type, size, geographical spread, heterogeneity of the technology layer, proportion and maturity of IT and OT implementations, the overall maturity of the prevailing cybersecurity implementation etc.\nFurther, all processes need to be monitored regularly for their effectiveness.\nGuidance on IT and Cybersecurity Operations Establishing Good Practices and Processes One of the key aspects of operations is the distribution of responsibilities and associated practices between the inward-looking IT operations and IT security teams and the outward-looking Information Security (Infosec) teams.\nThe IT Operations and IT Security teams form the first line of defence. They carry out defensive and protective activities such are patch, vulnerability and compliance management, system hardening, configuration baselining and change management, backup management, network access control, domain management, identity and role-based access management, service desk, ticketing and case management. The Information Security GRC and SOC teams form the second line of defence. They observe the internal and external environments, monitor the risk and detect cyber threats to the digital infrastructure. The IT Operations and IT Security teams also carry out many of the incident response and recovery activities, in close coordination with the SOC teams. Resilience of business, technology and cybersecurity operations and support essentially depends upon good operating and management practices and processes. These can be based on an Integrated Service Management (ISM) framework that combines both ITSM and ISMS and draws upon well-defined national/ international standards. Readers may refer to relevant material included under standards.\nDeveloping Workforce Competencies Modern IT Systems are reasonably large and complex, and the teams require different skill sets and expertise levels to handle the entire gamut of IT and Information Security operations effectively. The competency framework provides a broad structured approach and guidance to CSEs on how to establish a strategic program for ensuring cybersecurity competence in their workforce across their respective organisations.\nNote IT Ops teams must also contribute to securing the digital infrastucture. Managers can achieve this if they encourage their IT specialists to go beyond the functional and performance aspects of systems, networks, applications and databases. The specialists must develop competence in IT security aspects related to their job functions.\nThe NCIIPC-QCI Scheme for cybersecurity professionals incorporates essential IT security knowledge and skills in all the specialisation areas.\nLeveraging Technology as an Enabler A critical element for every organisation is the proper and effective use of technology by its workforce to achieve different cybersecurity functions. The following teams will benefit from technologies and platforms:\nEnterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) team, who are responsible for enterprise-wide governance, policies and management of risk and compliance. The CIO, IT Operations and IT Security teams and management personnel, who are responsible for day-to-day management of the digital infrastructure. The CISO, Information Security SOC teams, who are responsible for SOC operations. Besides the teams listed above, the following teams and groups require information and guidance on IT, OT and IS technologies, products, platforms, and solutions:\nThe Technology Strategy group, systems engineering and systems security engineering teams, who are responsible for conceptualisation, design, and implementation of systems. The acquisition and provisioning teams, who are responsible for preparation of RFPs and evaluation of solutions. Persons responsible for tracking and enhancing cybersecurity performance and maturity since technology usage is essential for achieving higher levels of cybersecurity capabilities. The technologies and platforms need to be selected based on relevance to the organisation’s business functions and processes. Readers are advised to refer to the resources section and Techsagar, the national repository of India’s cybertech capabilities, for identification of suitable ‘Made in India’ IT resources to meet IT/ IS requirements.\nAutomating the Processes using Technology Given the increased use of IT by CSEs, many of the manual and semi-automated IT and information security processes of yore need to be enhanced to higher levels of automation using technology. The Dev-Sec-Ops and CI/CD pipeline used in software development lifecycles are examples of modern process automation. Automation frameworks are also being developed for content-based processes such as governance, risk, compliance, audit, information sharing and AI/ML enabled decision support.\nCSEs can improve the efficiency of its workforce significantly by using standard operating processes (SOPs) for routine jobs and employing technology to run the standardised processes. Enabling manpower with technology to meet IT and IS, is strongly recommended.\nTo achieve automation and workforce enablement, it is essential for an organisation to have suitable manpower with adequate enablement through training, technology, and availability of resources to undertake jobs at levels as mentioned below:\nOperating Level: This is the basic workforce of most Organizations that is capable of “doing things” at the operating level. Operational Analytics Level: Competent workforce with capability to analyze issues at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels and suggest mitigation measures. This workforce needs IT-enabled analytical support tools to demonstrate reliability and efficiency in their operations. Design Level: This level requires experienced specialists with skills and competence to design the operating and analytical processes and configure the platforms, to execute them. Automation in CTI Sharing The critical success factors for cyber resilience and sustenance of the nation’s digital ecosystem are:\nThe speed and quality of detection of compromise and cyber-attacks within the entities. The rapidity by which information and guidance is disseminated to all the actual and potential targets. The speed and effectiveness of response within entities as well as across sectors and cross-sectors. Conventional paper-based and email-based methods of sharing are not capable of achieving the required speed in information sharing amongst all the stakeholders and participants, since they are less amenable for automated processing. Use of standardised STIX, TAXII and TLP protocols (or equivalent protocols) is a recommended for sharing CTI with speed and objectivity to counter cyber-attacks. Details of such protocols are covered in protocols section.\nCommunity-driven MISP platform and OASIS STIX/TAXII protocols with TLP based classification is considered well suited for the Indian IT ecosystem at this stage. A coherent approach is required for adopting TLP, MISP and STIX/ TAXII as the core elements for operational cybersecurity information sharing. Standardisation in this aspect can help achieve balance between speed (with ambiguity or inaccuracy) and correctness (with delays) in sharing of CTI.",

These guidelines emphasize creating scalable, interoperable, and flexible applications that adhere to open standards and leverage modular design principles, ensuring seamless integration across diverse platforms. They promote the development of Common Application Software (CAS), allowing states and departments to configure applications for specific needs without altering core functionalities, reducing duplication of efforts. The guidelines advocate for the adoption of open-source tools and configurable components to enhance innovation, minimize vendor lock-in, and streamline development processes. Additionally, they address metadata standards, multi-language support, and adherence to software engineering protocols to ensure consistency, security, and quality. By fostering reusability, scalability, and rapid deployment, the guidelines aim to facilitate the creation of robust, cloud-ready applications that align with MeitY’s vision for a digitally empowered society, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs for government and critical sectors.\nCloud Security Best Practices The guidelines provide a detailed framework to ensure the secure adoption and management of cloud services by government entities and other stakeholders. The document outlines essential security measures to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability in cloud environments. It covers areas such as access control, data encryption, incident response, compliance, and governance, emphasizing the shared responsibility model between cloud service providers (CSPs) and users. The guidelines aim to address risks like unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations while ensuring that cloud deployments align with regulatory requirements and international security standards. By following these best practices, organizations can minimize vulnerabilities, enhance trust in cloud technologies, and ensure the secure handling of sensitive information.\nGuidelines for Procurement of Cloud Services The guidelines provide a comprehensive framework to help government departments transition to cloud-based solutions while ensuring compliance with security and regulatory standards. These guidelines aim to standardize the procurement process, enabling government entities to adopt scalable, cost-efficient, and flexible cloud services effectively. They emphasize critical aspects such as Service Level Agreements (SLAs), data security, privacy, contractual terms, and risk management. The document offers a Master Service Agreement (MSA) template to address key concerns like data ownership, exit strategies, and dispute resolution while highlighting the differences between traditional IT and cloud service procurement. By outlining roles and responsibilities for stakeholders, such as cloud service providers (CSPs) and system integrators (SIs) and recommending best practices for safeguarding data integrity and availability, the guidelines ensure that digital transformation initiatives in the public sector are aligned with national objectives and operational requirements. These guidelines empower government departments to make informed decisions, promoting transparency, efficiency, and consistency in cloud adoption.\nGuidelines for Government Departments on Contractual Terms Related to Cloud Services The guidelines provide a structured framework to assist government entities in drafting and negotiating contracts with cloud service providers (CSPs). These guidelines aim to address critical contractual elements such as data ownership, security, privacy, liability, indemnity, termination, and exit management to safeguard the interests of government departments. By focusing on risk mitigation and compliance with regulatory and operational requirements, the guidelines ensure that cloud contracts are robust, clear, and enforceable. They empower government departments to establish fair and balanced agreements that protect sensitive data, ensure service continuity, and foster accountability, thereby enabling secure and efficient cloud adoption.\nGuidelines for User Departments on Service Level Agreement for Procuring Cloud Services The guidelines provide a structured approach for government departments to draft, evaluate, and enforce SLAs when adopting cloud services. These guidelines aim to ensure clarity and accountability between government users and cloud service providers by defining key performance metrics, responsibilities, and penalties for non-compliance. They address critical areas such as service uptime, data security, response times, and disaster recovery, ensuring that the agreed service levels meet operational and regulatory requirements. By offering a detailed SLA framework, the guidelines empower government departments to establish measurable expectations, monitor service performance, and safeguard their interests in cloud procurement agreements.\nMaster Service Agreement for Procurement of Cloud Services The MSA provides a standardized contractual framework to facilitate transparent and efficient cloud service procurement by government entities.

NCIIPC-QCI Conformity Assessment Framework for CSEs (2024) A set of Schemes for Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) for CSEs (CSMS Levels 1, 2 and 3), Certification of Cybersecurity Professionals, Accreditation of Consultancy Organisations and Training Bodies. B Technical Standards \u0026 Guidance (NIST, CIS, Others) a) Provide information about various technical controls to achieve cyber resilience in systems, networks etc. Also provide guidance and best practices for their implementation. b) Usually, no processes are defined in these standards as to how the controls should be managed by an organisation. c) The technical controls by themselves are descriptive in nature, describing the Control Objective and the Control itself. They correspond to Type B MSS (guidance documents). d) Mandatory application of technical controls is usually prescribed by regulators like RBI, CEA etc, as well as nodal agencies like NCIIPC, CERT-In, NSCS. There are similar/ equivalent regulators and nodal agencies in other countries. e) Technical controls are useful to establish the trustworthiness of systems, viz functionality and assurance. ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 Systems and software engineering —\nArchitecture description This International Standard addresses the creation, analysis and sustainment of architectures of systems through architecture descriptions. It provides a basis on which to compare and integrate architecture frameworks by providing a common ontology for specifying their contents. ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1:2024 Systems and software engineering Part 1Guidelines for life cycle management, available as a no-cost download.1,2 This document facilitates the joint usage of the process content of the latest revisions of both ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, by providing unified and consolidated guidance on life cycle management of systems and software. This is to help ensure consistency in system concepts and life cycle concepts, models, stages, processes, process application, key points of view, adaptation and use in various domains that will help project teams design a life cycle model for managing the progress of their project. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 are the documents that apply the concepts found in this document to specific processes. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023\nSystems and software engineering — System life cycle processes Establishes a common framework of process descriptions for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans. It defines a set of processes and associated terminology from an engineering viewpoint. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system’s structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system’s life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement of all stakeholders.\nProvides processes that support the definition, control and improvement of the system life cycle processes used within an organization or a project. Organizations and projects can use these processes when acquiring and supplying systems. ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017\nSystems and software engineering — Software life cycle processes Provides processes that can be employed for defining, controlling, and improving software life cycle processes within an organization or a project.\nThe processes, activities, and tasks can also be applied during the acquisition of a system that contains software.\nThe choice of whether to apply ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 for the software life cycle processes, or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, System life cycle processes, depends on the system-of-interest. Processes in both documents have the same process purpose and process outcomes but differ in activities and tasks to perform software engineering or systems engineering respectively. NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 1 Rev. 1, 16 Nov 22: Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems is available as a no-cost download.3 This publication describes a basis for establishing principles, concepts, activities, and tasks for engineering trustworthy secure systems. Such principles, concepts, activities, and tasks can be effectively applied within systems engineering efforts to foster a common mindset to deliver security for any system, regardless of the system’s purpose, type, scope, size, complexity, or the stage of its system life cycle. The intent of this publication is to advance systems engineering in developing trustworthy systems for contested operational environments (generally referred to as systems security engineering). NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2 Rev. 1, 09 Dec 21: Developing Cyber-Resilient Systems - A Systems Security Engineering Approach is available as a no-cost download.4 This document focuses on cyber resiliency engineering—an emerging specialty system engineering discipline applied in conjunction with systems security engineering and resilience engineering to develop survivable, trustworthy secure systems. Cyber resiliency engineering intends to architect, design, develop, implement, maintain, and sustain the trustworthiness of systems with the capability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stress, attacks, or compromises that use or are enabled by cyber resources. From a risk management perspective, cyber resiliency is intended to help reduce the mission, business, organizational, enterprise, or sector risk of depending on cyber resources. NIST SP 800-53rev5 The control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls). Controls are organized into 20 families and over 1000 controls. Significant changes in SP 800-53rev5: a) Making the controls more outcome-based by removing the entity responsible for satisfying the control (i.e., information system, organization) from the control statement; b) Separating control selection processes from the controls, thereby allowing the controls to be used by different communities of interest; c) Removing control baselines and tailoring guidance from the publication and transferring the content to SP 800-53B; d) Clarifying the relationship between requirements and controls; e) Incorporating new, state-of-the-practice controls (e.g., controls to support cyber resiliency, support secure systems design, and strengthen security and privacy governance and accountability) based on the latest threat intelligence and cyber-attack data. NIST SP 800-53A Provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of controls. a) Security and privacy control assessments are the principal vehicle used to verify that selected security and privacy controls are implemented and meet the stated goals and objectives. They are not about checklists, simple pass/fail results, or paperwork to pass inspections or audits. b) SP 800-53A facilitates security control assessments and privacy control assessments conducted within an effective risk management framework. A major design objective for SP 800-53A is to provide an assessment framework and initial starting point for assessment procedures that are flexible enough to meet the needs of different organizations while providing consistency in conducting control assessments. NIST SP 800-53B Security and privacy control baselines, guidance for tailoring control baselines and for developing overlays to support the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders and their organizations. a) Organizations select a security control baseline (low-impact, moderate-impact, high-impact baseline) and privacy control baseline as described in Chapter Three. b) Once the control baseline is selected, organizations apply the tailoring guidance provided in Chapter Two to help ensure that the resulting controls are necessary and sufficient to manage security risk and privacy risk. NIST SP 800-53 Appendix C Two fundamental concepts that affect the trustworthiness of systems are functionality and assurance. a) Functionality is defined in terms of the security and privacy features, functions, mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational systems and programs and the environments in which those systems and programs operate. b) Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate and enforce established security and privacy policies. NIST CSF v2.0 (2024)\nCSF is a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risk. It is composed of three parts: the Framework Core, the Framework Implementation Tiers, and the Framework Profiles. Provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to: 1) Describe their current cybersecurity posture; 2) Describe their target state for cybersecurity; 3) Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process; 4) Assess progress toward the target state; 5) Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk. CNSSI No. 1253, 27 Mar 2014 Companion document to the NIST publications relevant to categorization and security control selection Identify applicability of security controls in SP 800-53 based on impact values. The 3-by-3 matrix has nine columns showing three possible impact values (low, moderate, or high) for each of the three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, or availability). NIST SP 800-37rev2, 20 Dec 2018 Provides a comprehensive risk management process. NIST SP 800-37 defines two approaches for the selection of security and privacy controls: a) Baseline control selection approach uses control baselines, which are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to meet the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. The control baselines serve as a starting point for the protection of individuals’ privacy, information, and information systems. b) Organization-generated control selection approach. NIST SP 800-39, 01 Mar 2011 Provides guidance on risk management processes and strategies. Provide guidance for an integrated, organization-wide program for managing information security risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation and use of federal information systems. NIST SP 800-30rev1, 17 Sep 2012 Provides guidance on the risk assessment process. Provide guidance for conducting risk assessments of federal information systems and organizations, amplifying the guidance in Special Publication 800-39. Risk assessments, carried out at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy, are part of an overall risk management process—providing senior leaders and executives with information to determine appropriate courses of action in response to identified risks. CIS Critical Security Controls V8 CIS Controls V8 combines and consolidates the CIS Controls by activities, rather than by who manages the devices. CIS CSC V8 has 18 Controls, 153 Safeguards and 3 Implementation Groups NERC CIP Standards maintained by the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC), an International Regulatory Authority under oversight of the Federal Energy Regulation Commission (FERC). The North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) plan is a set of standards aimed at regulating, enforcing, monitoring and managing the security of the Bulk Electric System (BES) in North America. These standards apply specifically to the cybersecurity aspects of BES. The CIP standards provide a cybersecurity framework to identify and secure critical assets that can impact the efficient and reliable supply of electricity of North America’s BES.

It operates a globally inclusive, trusted and reliable infrastructure to send and receive financial transactions.\nSwift Standards works with the user community to specify and publish Market Practice - rules and best-practice advice on how standards should be deployed to meet business needs or to comply with regulation.\nThe Swift Standards group maintains several important message standards. The Swift MT standard is used for international payments, cash management, trade finance and treasury business. Swift Standards, under contract to ISO, also maintains two open messaging standards: ISO 15022 used for securities settlement and asset servicing, and ISO 20022 scoped to all financial industry processes. Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/ CSA is one of the world’s leading organizations committed to awareness, practical implementation, and certification for the future of cloud and cybersecurity.\nThe CSA has a Security, Trust, Assurance and Risk (STAR) program for security assurance in the cloud. The CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a cybersecurity control framework for cloud computing. It is composed of 197 control objectives that are structured in 17 domains covering all key aspects of cloud technology. It can be used as a tool for systematic assessment of cloud implementation, providing guidance on which security controls should be implemented by which actor within the cloud supply chain. The controls framework is aligned to the CSA Security Guidance for Cloud Computing.\nhttps://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/guidance HITRUST\nhttps://hitrustalliance.net/ HITRUST offers a portfolio of assessments and certifications to validate the security of systems, data, and environments. The HITRUST CSF is a comprehensive, threat-adaptive control library harmonizing 60+ frameworks and standards. It enables tailored, risk-based assessments and supports consistent, efficient cybersecurity and compliance across varied industry needs. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html USA’s Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 establishes federal standards protecting sensitive health information from disclosure without patient’s consent. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the HIPAA Privacy Rule to implement HIPAA requirements.\nIndian entities use HIPAA primarily when dealing with US healthcare data or clients. They also implement HIPAA-like safeguards to meet global data security standards. Secure Controls Framework (SCF) https://www.securecontrolsframework.com/ SCF is a volunteer-driven meta framework with a catalog of controls from over 100 cybersecurity and data privacy laws, regulations and frameworks. The SCF control catalog contains over 1200 controls and is logically organised into 33 domains.\nThe SCF normalises disparate control language into something that is usable across technology, cybersecurity, privacy and other departments where they can share the same control language. Thus, the SCF enables both intra- and inter-organisation standardisation.\nSCF is useful for entities that must comply with multiple standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, NIST CSF). The Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 and Information Technology Rules (Privacy Rules) are already added into the SCF control catalog. Other authoritative sources of Law, Regulation or Framework (LRF) prescribed by Indian regulators, QCI etc can also be added. MITRE Frameworks MITRE ATT\u0026CK\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/ MITRE ATT\u0026CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT\u0026CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. MITRE D3FEND\nhttps://d3fend.mitre.org/ MITRE D3FEND is a framework of defensive countermeasures that help in assessing, planning and tailoring the defences for generally known ATT\u0026CK tactics.\nThe countermeasures address every stage of the attack-cycle. The five main defensive techniques are Harden, Detect, Isolate, Deceive, and Evict.\nD3FEND can assist organisations in creating standard vocabulary for the specific functions of countermeasures. The defensive functions of the organisation can be validated against a corresponding ATT\u0026CK offensive technique to help identify gaps and weaknesses. MITRE Engage\nhttps://engage.mitre.org/ MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations. It provides defenders with goal-driven approaches to evolve their defenses and remain in control. The adversary engagement approach helps defenders craft internal deception infrastructure to expose, manipulate, and understand your adversaries. MISP\nhttps://www.misp-project.org/ MISP is an open-source threat intelligence sharing platform. The documentation is maintained in https://github.com/MISP/misp-book.\nCIRCL operates several MISP instances (for different types of constituents) to improve automated detection and responsiveness to targeted and cybersecurity attacks in Luxembourg and outside.\nhttps://www.circl.lu/services/misp-malware-information-sharing-platform/. ITIL Service Management Framework ITIL 4.0 comprises of 34 practices grouped in four areas of management - General Management Practices, adopted and adapted for service management from general business management domains (14 domains); Service Management Practices developed in service management and ITSM industries (17 domains); and Technical Management Practices, adapted from technology management domains for service management purposes by expanding or shifting their focus from technology solutions to IT services (3 domains). ISO/ IEC Service Management Framework ISO/IEC 20000 series of standards are a set of documents that detail what needs to be done to build an IT Service Management System (ITSM). Though very similar to each other, ISO/IEC 20000 gives a framework and methodology for ITSM, while ITIL gives the best practices for it. Explanatory Notes Many of the IS, ISO, IEC and ITU-T standards are mandated by the regulatory bodies and national nodal agencies. Any guidance that is based on IS, ISO, IEC, ITU-T standards provides the following advantages:\nThese standards are maintained and regularly updated by an international panel of experts, which also has Indian participation.\nThe ISO standards can be easily extended to include any additional requirements, especially those that are defined under the Indian law and regulation, or available in global frameworks like NIST, CIS, CSA etc. The standards can provide a common baseline reference amongst all the NCRF stakeholders, especially in the i) definition and usage of various terms, ii) governance, management, risk, compliance and audit frameworks, iii) implementation and continual improvement approaches, and iv) standardisation of processes related to verification, validation, measurement and audit. The common baseline reference will ensure that the possibility of misunderstanding amongst the stakeholders is minimal.\nEntities can get their organisations certified against specific management standards. The entities can also procure and use the other guidance and technical standards to help them in maximising the effectiveness during implementation.\nThere will be synergy between the entities and their internal/ external experts, consultants, implementers and auditors, since everyone refers to the same set of standards. In practice, this is already being done with regard to popular standards such as ISO 9000, ISO 27000 and IEC 62443 series.\nThe oversight mechanism of Government bodies, regulators and national nodal agencies is easily harmonised when all bodies adopt a commonly accepted set of standards.\nThere is already a large pool of consultants, implementers and auditors in India, who have the knowledge, expertise and experience in implementing and auditing entities based on these standards. Capacity building of this pool, both in terms of quantity of personnel and quality of expertise, can be taken up through various national and international forums. Both ISO and IEC invest in strengthening the skills of its members, both at the human and the organisational level, through extensive training and technical assistance programmes. The capacity building programmes of ISO and IEC may be explored further.\nBIS, a member of ISO and IEC, has a mechanism in place for standardisation and supply of standards at reasonable prices within the Indian ecosystem. Similarly, Department of Telecom (DoT) represents India at the ITU-T and QCI is a member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), a worldwide association of accreditation bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment. Through these organisations, the Indian Government and ecosystem can maximise the effectiveness of use of globally recognised standards and frameworks.\nThe ISO and IEC are exploring new ways to provide dynamic deliverables that adapt to the needs of users in a much more flexible way. Together, they are developing a common vision for Standards that are Machine Applicable Readable and Transferable (SMART)5,6. The SMART standards will be modular, machine readable, and eventually, machine interpretable and executable. The corresponding Indian Standards can hugely benefit from this initiative.\nIn view of the advantages listed above, the concepts and guidance have been built upon and aligned with a selected set of IS, ISO, IEC and ITU-T reference standards that are relevant and applicable to the Indian ecosystem. All the stakeholders are encouraged to develop their understanding of the core principles, approaches, methods and processes described in these base set of standards, so that the concepts and guidance can be used effectively. The regulated and critical sector entities will benefit significantly if they obtain further guidance from the IS/ISO/IEC and other standards listed below:\nGovernance of IT and information security, based on ISO/IEC 38500, 27014, COBIT etc\nService Management System (SMS) that are typically based on IS/ISO/IEC 20000 family.\nInformation Security Management System (ISMS) that are typically based on IS/ISO/IEC 27000 family, including sector specific standards.\nISO 27013 standard that assists organisations in implementing both ISO 27001 and ISO 20000-1 concurrently or in implementing one where another is already in place.\nOT Security that are typically based on IEC 62443 series.\nOther standards related to IT asset management, audit etc.\nOther frameworks such as NIST, CIS, CSA etc.\nhttps://www.iso.org/standard/72896.html ↩︎\nhttps://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html ↩︎\nhttps://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1-rev-1/final ↩︎\nhttps://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-2-rev-1/final ↩︎\nhttps://www.iso.org/smart ↩︎\nhttps://etech.iec.ch/issue/2022-04/alongside-iec-standards-certification-is-becoming-smart ↩︎",

    "content": "This compendium of IT and Information Security formats and protocols is summarised from the original sources for information only. Readers must consult the authoritative sources for the actual guidelines.\nOpen automation formats and protocols are essential tools that facilitate interoperability and integration among various systems, devices, and software applications. Designed to enable standardised communication, these formats and protocols provide a common language for systems in industries such as cyber security, telecommunications, and IT, allowing for seamless automation processes across diverse platforms. Some of these relevant for cyber security are referred in subsequent paras with purpose and usage.\nSTIX Overview: To share CTI, it is imperative that the underlying platform converts the data into a form that is ready for being sent through the network. To that end a process is required to convert the data-object (a combination of code and data) in a form so that the state of the object is saved in a transmittable format. This is known as Serialization . Once the data is received at the destination in a Serialized form, it is Deserialized before further processing. STIX stands for Structured Threat Information Expression. It is an open source, XML based “language and serialization format used to exchange” CTI. STIX is a standardized language for representing and sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) in a consistent, machine-readable format. Developed by MITRE and now managed by OASIS, STIX enables organisations to share detailed threat information, including attack patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and threat actor profiles. The structured nature of STIX allows cybersecurity tools to process threat data automatically, enhancing detection, analysis, and response capabilities across systems\nPurpose: Leveraging STIX, organisations can collaborate effectively while exchanging CTI because of the consistency and machine readability that STIX provides. Consequently, security communities benefit as anticipation to attacks improve and agility in response mechanisms is enhanced. Further, its design is such that it augments capabilities, such as “collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response” .\nUsage: STIX at its core architectural layer contains “observables” that it refers to as “stateful properties or measurable events”, pertaining to the “operation of computers and networks”. For example, it could be stopping a service, reboot of a system or establishing a connection. Storage of these “observables” is done in XML using “CybOX language, another MITRE project”. Further, as a part of the framework, these “observables can be linked to indicators, incidents, TTPs, specific threat actors, adversary campaigns, specific targets, data markings, and courses of action” - that it evolves into a “complete threat intelligence management system”.\nTAXII Overview: TAXII stands for Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information. It is an “application protocol for exchanging CTI over HTTPS, defining “a RESTful API (a set of services and message exchanges) and a set of requirements for TAXII Clients and Servers” . An API, or an Application Programming Interface plays the role of a mediator between the Client and the Web Service. The advantage here is that information sharing is done “maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what”. A RESTful (or REST - representational state transfer) API “conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services”. For an API to be a RESTful API, it needs to comply with certain criteria like “Client-server architecture”, with HTTP based requests, “Stateless Client-Server communication”, “Cacheable data” etc.\nPurpose: It enables sharing CTI “across product, service and organisational boundaries” and acts as a “transport vehicle for STIX structured threat information”.\nUsage: The two primary services TAXII provides are: (a) Collection and (b) Channel. The TAXII server has a repository of CTI objects that it allows its Users to host, which can be accessed by consumers. Collection is an interface to this repository. A Channel can be viewed as a many to many interface - that allows a producer to push data to many consumers and a consumer to receive data from many producers.\nTraffic Light Protocol (TLP) Information Sharing The critical success factors for cyber resilience and sustenance of a digital ecosystem are: a)\tThe speed and quality of detection of compromise and cyber-attacks within the entities. b)\tThe rapidity by which information and guidance is disseminated to all the actual and potential targets. c)\tThe speed and effectiveness of response within entities as well as across sectors and cross-sectors.\nConventional paper-based and email-based methods of sharing are not capable of achieving the required speed in information sharing amongst all the stakeholders and participants, since they are less amenable for automated processing. Traffic Light Protocol is a standardised mechanism for sharing information. TLP version 2.0 is the current version of TLP standardized by FIRST. The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration. Information sharing happens from an information source, towards one or more recipients. TLP is a set of four labels used to indicate the sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipients.\nTLP definitions Community: Under TLP, a community is a group who share common goals, practices, and informal trust relationships. A community can be as broad as all cybersecurity practitioners in a country (or in a sector or region).\nOrganisation: Under TLP, an organisation is a group who share a common affiliation by formal membership and are bound by common policies set by the organisation. An organisation can be as broad as all members of an information sharing organisation, but rarely broader.\nClients: Under TLP, clients are those people or entities that receive cybersecurity services from an organisation. Clients are by default included in TLP:AMBER so that the recipients may share information further downstream in order for clients to take action to protect themselves. For teams with national responsibility this definition includes stakeholders and constituents.\nTLP Labels TLP:RED = For the eyes and ears of individual recipients only, no further disclosure. Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon without significant risk for the privacy, reputation, or operations of the organisations involved. Recipients may therefore not share TLP:RED information with anyone else. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting.\nTLP:AMBER = Limited disclosure, recipients can only spread this on a need-to-know basis within their organisation and its clients. Note that TLP:AMBER+STRICT restricts sharing to the organisation only. Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organisations involved. Recipients may share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organisation and its clients, but only on a need-to-know basis to protect their organisation and its clients and prevent further harm. Note: if the source wants to restrict sharing to the organisation only, they must specify TLP:AMBER+STRICT.\nTLP:GREEN = Limited disclosure, recipients can spread this within their community. Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful to increase awareness within their wider community. Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner organisations within their community, but not via publicly accessible channels. TLP:GREEN information may not be shared outside of the community. Note: when “community” is not defined, assume the cybersecurity/defence community.\nTLP:CLEAR = Recipients can spread this to the world, there is no limit on disclosure. Sources may use TLP:CLEAR when information carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:CLEAR information may be shared without restriction.\nOSCAL Overview: In the context of NIST, an ATO or an Authorization (to operate) is defined as “The official management decision given by a senior organisational official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organisational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organisational assets, individuals, other organisations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls” . In essence there has to be a formal declaration by a designated authority that authorises operation of an IT product, which includes all the caveats around Risk. Apart from the inherent complexity in handling cyber threats, addressing ATO requirements coupled with the extensive manual processes in handling Risk Management increases the challenges of an Entity’s Information Security Team. The four key challenges in this regard stated by NIST are: - (a) Complexity of Information Technology (b) Omnipresent Vulnerabilities (c) Burdensome nature of Regulatory Frameworks (d) Esoteric nature of Risk Management (e) Accelerated rate of obsolescence of Documentation .\nPurpose: The open source, Open Security Controls Assessment Language - or OSCAL, was developed by NIST in collaboration with industry to address the concerns around this space. To overcome the challenges around usage of word processing and spread sheet utilities to handle RMF requirements, improved automation was an imperative. There was a need, therefore, to evolve “a shared language for authorization systems to communicate”.\nUsage: OSCAL uses XML, JSON, and YAML formats, providing “machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results”. The advantages of OSCAL formats as stated by NIST are: - “Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs, Establish and share machine-readable control baselines, Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in your systems, Automate the monitoring and assessment of your system control implementation effectiveness” .\nOpenSCAP Overview: In any enterprise, the IT systems deployed need to be constantly monitored for vulnerabilities so that remediation measures in terms of configuration changes, patch updates and / or application of upgrades are done in a timely manner. This minimizes risk exposure of the assets within, and the enterprise is better guarded against security threats. The Security Content Automation Protocol - SCAP, is a collection of “number of open standards that are widely used to enumerate software flaws and configuration issues related to security”. In order to associate a metric or measure the possible impact due to the vulnerabilities within the system, applications written for security monitoring leverage these standards. Thus the “SCAP suite of specifications standardize the nomenclature and formats”, that is leveraged by these vulnerability management tools.\nPurpose: OpenSCAP is an auditing tool that utilizes security check-list content in a defined format called the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF). Combing with other specifications it creates a SCAP-expressed checklist that can be processed by SCAP-validated products.\nAudience: IT / IT Security Administrators, Auditors\nUsage: The OpenSCAP stack consists of different products that can help with “assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines”, maintaining “flexibility and interoperability” and “reducing the costs of performing security audits” . A few of the Tools in the stack include: - (a) OpenSCAP Base: A Command line tool for performing configuration \u0026 vulnerability scanning (b) OpenSCAP Daemon: Evaluating Infrastructure’s compliance to SCAP Policy (c) SCAP Workbench: Helps create a custom security profile and facilitates remote scanning.\nOpen Command \u0026 Control (OpenC2) Overview: Attackers are in a position to conduct and coordinate various stages of an attack with remarkable sophistication and speed. If Defenders are to sustain their operations, they need to respond with equal alacrity; plan and conduct defense operations in a timeframe that matches the adversary so as to ensure that the latter fails to attain their objectives. But the penetrability of an attack surface is determined by a range of factors that include “complexity, functionality, connectivity” etc. Further, most enterprises do not have an integrated cyber defense implementation; the systems operate in siloes and generally have static configurations. This results in very inefficient cybersecurity operations. Such an environment, by default creates a lag in incident-response-remediation, which gives an adversary “asymmetric time advantage”, to ensure the success of their attack. In a large enterprise there would be number of heterogenous platforms, technologies, devices, and systems. Effective incident response, getting into the root cause, assessing remediation measures, and mitigating them etc. become complex. In such a context, few challenges of integrating the various components of cyber defense include: - (a) Prohibitive costs (b) Tailored Communication Interfaces” (c) Extent of tight-coupling and cohesiveness of the chosen products for integration (d) Need for a middleware etc. As a consequence, scaling of such a solution would depend on ability to get suitable interfaces written or easily available APIs for the different products in use. Paradoxically though, while OEM diversity of solutions do provide an additional layer of security - as attack on one system does not guarantee attack on another, achieving cyber defense integration becomes complex and prohibitive in terms of costs. From an attack perspective, when an attacker penetrates a system and installs a malware which is leveraged to send remote commands from a C2 (Command \u0026 Control) Server to infected devices, it is termed a C2 attack. In other words, “command and control infrastructure” is used by attackers to issue “command and control instructions” to their victims. From a cyber-defense viewpoint, an assessment of the C2 approach and methods that an attacker uses could be leveraged to identify and associate attackers and attacks, and disrupt malicious activity that are ongoing.\nPurpose: The limitations in integrating cyber defense solutions, stated earlier was the trigger for development of Open Command and Control (OpenC2) . It “is a suite of specifications that enable command and control of cyber defense systems and components” - facilitating “machine to machine communication”, through a “common language”. More important, it does it at very high speeds and in such a way “that is agnostic of the overall underlying technologies utilized”. But for this standard, every new device would need manual configuration or individual commands sent in real time, which apart from increasing the lag in incident response times, would also have human intervention, making it error prone.\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) Overview: The entire source code of a software is referred to as its codebase. It is a common practice for developers to integrate with their code, third party components that are licensed and either commercially available or are open source. A SBOM or software Bill of Materials is an inventory of all the “open source and third-party components” that are present, providing details of their versions and status of the patches within the codebase of a software application / product. Information security teams can use this information to assess security \u0026 license related risks. Akin to the Manufacturing industry’s Bill of Material (from where SBOM has been derived) where the codification schemes of the parts provided by OEM and Suppliers are distinct, based on which a successful trace to the correct supplier happens when a part goes defective; here too a trail to the accurate third party is established by virtue of the SBOM. There are four stages of an SBOM life cycle. They are: (a) Produce SBOM - Collating the information required for an SBOM at each stage of the software lifecycle from existing tools and solutions. Such solutions normally include: - “intellectual property review”, “license management workflow tools”, “version control systems” etc. (b) Deliver - In the case of opensource tools, the SBOM information can be held as metadata, while for compiled versions the SBOM and the software product are bundled together. (c) Update - If the software is updated in any manner, then any changes in SBOM too needs to be recorded. (d) Consume - In order to utilise SBOM, the SBOM data should be in a machine readable format. However, the decision on choosing the appropriate format that should be adopted for SBOM needs to be taken. The three standard and common formats in use are CycloneDX, SWID and SPDX.\nCycloneDX Purpose: “OWASP CycloneDX is a lightweight” SBOM specification “designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis”, created in 2017 . The intent was to create a “fully automatable, security-focused SBOM standard”. Existing specifications like Package URL, CPE, SWID etc., have been incorporated into CycloneDX. Each such SBOM can have (a) Bill of Material Metadata (supplier, manufacturer, firmware etc. that it describes), (b) Components - detailed inventory of the software components, which includes type, identity, license etc. (c) Services - description of external APIs, that the utility may invoke (d) Dependencies - interrelationship between components (e) Compositions - that describes the ‘completeness’ of the SBOM. (f) Extensions - For building rapid prototyping of enhancements.\nUsage: Software Inventory description, Analysis, Analysis of vulnerabilities and their mitigation, Supply Chain (Software) risk assessments, Compliance of License requirements, Traceability of updates and modifications, Integrity checks of signed components etc.\nSWID Purpose: To enhance transparency in monitoring Software installed within the enterprise, Software Identification (SWID) tags were conceptualised and defined originally by ISO (2012) and later updated as ISO/IEC standard (2015). Description of a specific software release is held in the SWID Tag files. The standard further “defines a lifecycle where a SWID Tag is added to an endpoint as part of the software product’s installation process and deleted by the product’s uninstall process”. In order to capture the lifecycle of a software component, the SWID specification defines following types of Tags: (a) Primary Tag (b) Patch Tag (c) Corpus Tag and (d) Supplemental Tag. SWID Tag that identifies and describes: - (a) a software product installed on a computing device is called a Patch Tag (b) a patch that was installed for making a change of the software installed on the device is referred to as a Patch Tag (c) the pre-installation state of a software product is called a Corpus tag and finally a SWID Tag that permits “additional information to be associated with any referenced SWID tag” is referred to as a Supplemental tag.\nUsage: Few use cases are: (a) It can be used as Software Bill of Material for the software products and applications installed (b) Inventory of installed software can be regularly monitored (c) Software vulnerability identification at end points can be carried out (d) Ensures proper patch management (e) Detects unauthorized or corrupt software prior to their installation and prevents their installation.\nSPDX Purpose: SPDX or Software Package Data Exchange , is an ISO /IEC standard. It is used for communicating software bill of material information that includes components, licenses, copyright and security information. It is an evolving “set of data exchange standards” that would assist enterprises with their software supply chain ecosystem by allowing each of them “to share human-readable and machine-processable software metadata” with one another. Like in the case of SWID, stated earlier, work here too began because of limitations that existed in the earlier days of sharing opensource components, resulting in duplication of efforts. Also, collaboration was difficult then. SPDX project created “a common metadata exchange format” which allowed details about software packages and associated content to be collected, shared and made effective automation of the related tasks, feasible. The file formats used here include JSON, XML and YAML. A valid SPDX document has a defined structure with defined sections as stated in the SPDX specification. The section that is mandatory is the “Creation Information’ (version numbers, license of data etc.) - primarily provided for forward and backward compatibility of the tools. The others include “Package Information”, “File Information”, “Snippet Information” and “Other Licensing Information.\nUsage: Description of software components and their interrelationships; Tracking licensing, copyright information related to IP; Tracking executables to the source files etc.\nOpenIOC Overview: Like in the case of collating evidence, analyzing them and then weaving it together to reconstruct a crime scene, a cybersecurity analyst too as a part of her function tries to gather data around different events related to new and emerging threats. The nature of this data could be “metadata elements or much more complex malicious code and content samples that require advanced reverse engineering”. The final output of this action is what is generally referred to as IOC or Indicators of compromise. In other words, IOC can be defined as “a forensic artifact or remnant of an intrusion that can be identified on a host or network”.\nPurpose: OpenIOC is an XML based open framework used for sharing CTI.\nUsage: The format used is machine-readable and assists sharing threats related to the latest IOCs, with other enterprises, helping achieve real-time protection. OpenIoc provides a pre-defined set of indicators as a part of the framework. The extensible nature of the base schema allows add on indicators from different sources. The IOC use cases include: (a) Finding Malware - Used to find known malware (b) Methodology - These IOCs help find suspicious utilities that are unknown. For instance, writing an IOC for a specific condition of an unsigned dll that was loaded from a folder that did not have “windows32system” in its path (c) Bulk - Used for exact matches (d) Investigative - Tracking information like, metadata related to “installation of backdoors”, “execution of tools” etc. in an IOC and using that to prioritise the systems that would be taken up to be analysed.\nOpenEDR Overview: Endpoint detection and response or EDR is a technology that focuses on endpoints and network related events. The agent on the host system helps log the information generated and stores it in a database. This repository is what is leveraged for event monitoring and generating reports. Different EDR solutions package their functions and features differently. Some focus more at the agent level, some have different way of handling schedules for collection and analysis, some others carry out integration tasks with a difference. Functions of EDR are: (a) Traffic and data monitoring from endpoints and checking for anomalies hinting a breach. (b) Automated responses - Removal of malicious files and alerts to information security teams. (c) Search for threats and their signatures through analytics. The core functions of all tools in this space are the same - “continuous monitoring and analysis” for being proactive to respond to threats.\nPurpose: OpenEDR is an EDR tool that is both free and its source code available in public domain. It consists of the following components: - (a) Core Library (b) Service (c) Process Monitoring (d) System Monitor (e) File-System Mini-Filter (f) Network Monitor (g) Low-Level Registry Monitoring Component (h) Self-Protection Provider (i) Low-Level Process Monitoring Component.\nUsage: One of OpenEDR’s strengths is to enable a user to affect an accurate RCA. Without a clear understanding of root cause, mitigation measures would prove inadequate. The output from the tool provides “actionable knowledge” which helps speed up response. Further its, “Integrated Security Architecture” helps deliver a “Full Attack Vector Visibility including MITRE Framework”.\nOpenDXL Overview: Proliferation of different technologies from various IT Infra and Security Vendors over time, with different upgrade paths, coupled with several home-grown initiatives – all, connected through an underlying network, has made IT Security Management a complex task. Achieving seamless integration between security products from different Vendors has been a constant challenge. API driven integration comes with major maintenance issues. Integration of products from different Vendors also has administrative overheads that includes external dependencies. For instance, getting a buy in from each of the Vendors, their prioritization, commercial interests etc. An application’s limitations for easily accessing emerging CTI data becomes an impediment for each, to apply the insights on emerging threats, making the environment vulnerability prone. As a result, the cyber resilience posture is affected adversely. The mechanism through which security solutions are connected and integration of disparate security systems are achieved is termed as Orchestration. Since substantial volume of output logs are created by security tools currently, SOCs tend to miss intrusions. Security Orchestration addresses this concern.\nPurpose: Open Data Exchange Layer or OpenDXL has been developed with the intent of enabling “security devices to share intelligence and orchestrate security operations in real time”. It facilitates the developer community to establish handshakes between security products and minimize lead times of threat defense, by improving “context of analysis”, shortening “workflows of the threat defense lifecycle” etc. The key goals of OpenDXL can be summarized as follows: (a) Enhance flexibility (b) Make integration easier (c) Accelerate development by providing appropriate toolsets (d) Increase Sec Ops ability in creating “cross-product, cross-vendor security automation” and (e) Ensure that API changes by Vendors do not adversely impact integration.\nUsage: Use Cases include: “Deception threat events, File and application reputation changes, Mobile devices and assets discovered, Network and user behavior changes, High-fidelity alerts, Vulnerability and indicator of compromise (IoC) data”.\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) Overview: Like all disciplines in IT, managing IT Infrastructure has gone through its own evolution process. In the past it was customary for manually addressing all aspects of configuration, whether it was hardware or software over which the applications were required to run on. Costs, scalability, availability were all challenges that the organisations had to surmount. Monitoring performance of IT Infra or pinpointing the problem during troubleshooting continued to be an Achilles heel for the IT Infra team. Due to the human intensive nature of deploying configurations, inconsistencies crept in. Therefore, there was a need to explore the possibility of automating configuration management and thereby managing and provisioning IT Infrastructure through code. In that context, two file formats are defined here: (a) JSON: JSON or JavaScript Object Notation originated as a page scripting language in the Netscape Navigator era, for its web browser. It is a format with a defined set of rules that is “text-based, human-readable”, leveraged for data exchange between “web clients and web servers”, sometimes used as an alternative to XML. (b) YAML: YAML or yet another markup language (referred to also as, ain’t another markup language) - A human readable, easily comprehensible language, used for data and not documents is a “data serialization language” which is regularly leveraged while writing configuration files.\nPurpose: Infrastructure as Code or IaC, is defined as “The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools”. In effect it leverages a DevOps approach to deploy IT infrastructure - networks, VMs etc. Akin to a codebase generating identical binary every time, here too the same environment is generated during every deployment. There are two approaches to IaC: (a) Declarative - Where the required state of the system is defined. An environment would need a tailored definition with regards its components and configuration. The definition file describes that. Depending on the kind file formats that the Platform supports - be they JSON, YAML or XML, syntax for describing IaC can be decided. (b) Imperative - “defines the specific commands needed to achieve the desired configuration”.\nUsage: Some of the advantages of using IaC are: (a) Reduce Cost (b) Accelerate deployment (c) Less Errors (d) Enhance consistency (e) “Eliminate configuration drift”. More insights can be gleaned from studying Server automation and config management tools like Chef, Puppet, Saltstack etc.\nPolicy-as-Code Overview: In a growing tech landscape, it is inevitable not to think of automation when rolling out policies. As proliferation of IT driven solutions take place, protecting the systems from threats is an imperative. For which, rules and procedures are defined as a part of security policy formulation - be it, access control, authorization, network security etc. In essence, a policy is a rule that stipulates the criteria for code deployment against the backdrop of the security control implemented or a set of steps to be executed automatically when there is a particular security event.\nPurpose: Policy-as-code is the use of a high-level declarative language to automate managing rules and policies centrally. Leveraging this approach, users write the policies using Python, YAML or Rego - a high-level declarative language “built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures”, depending on the kind of policy-as-code tool that is being used. While IaC benefits the IT operations team where automated provisioning of Infrastructure is involved, policy-as-code focuses on security operations and compliance management. To leverage policy-as-code the user may choose to use a tool like Open Policy Agent or OPA, purpose of which is to provide a common framework while applying policy-as-code to any domain. OPA is a “general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack”. It allows authoring of policies through Rego. OPA can be leveraged to outsource policy decisions from the relevant service. Eg: Boolean decisions of whether an API call should be allowed, Quota left for a user, the updates to be applied for a particular resource etc.\nUsage: The advantages of using policy-as-code are: (a) Enhanced efficiency of enforcement and sharing of policies vis-a-vis the manual route (b) Accelerated operations because of automated policy enforcement (c) Swifter reviewing of policies as there is no requirement for engineers to discuss, they need to only examine the code (d) Improved collaboration within and across teams (e) Accuracy (f) Well defined version controlling of the policies and ability to roll back to the previous version (g) Helps reduce critical errors in production environments.\nOMG Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF) Overview: Requirements management has been in vogue across different industries for a while. The collaboration requirements in the manufacturing industry – car manufacturing, for instance, uses dedicated authoring tools for their requirement management. Since collaboration requirements are intense, requirements management cross organisational boundaries - and different entities using different authoring tools find it a challenge to work on the same requirements repository. There was a compelling case, therefore, for a “generic, non-proprietary format” for information exchange. Hence, The Requirements Interchange Format or ReqIF was created for enterprises to exchange requirements data, by transferring XML documents that comply to the ReqIF format.\nPurpose: Any product development during the initial stages has a requirement gathering phase. This is where ReqIF finds a key use, as multiple entities could be involved. ReqIF facilitates seamless sharing of requirements between agencies, even if each uses a different tool. It is far more efficient than formats like Word, Excel or PDF as it “allows for a loss-free exchange”.\nUsage: Few of the advantages of using this format are: Improved collaboration between entities; Obviates the need to use the same authoring tools, Agencies interacting with multiple entities (eg: Suppliers) do not need stack up authoring tools that their respective Customers use.\nOASIS CACAO for Cybersecurity Overview: It is apparent that in order to defend against cybersecurity threats, a structured set of rules need to be defined. A cybersecurity playbook is generally considered to be a comprehensive manual that spells out actions to be taken when there is theft or loss of data. To that end, enterprises need to “identify, create, and document the prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps”, currently in most cases done manually. These steps considered together, constitute a course of action playbook. Like in other areas of the cybersecurity domain, here too lack of a standard mechanism to “document and share these playbooks across organisational boundaries” compounded with inadequate automation, proves to be a challenge.\nPurpose: OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (or CACAO) for Cyber Security Technical Committee (TC), tackles this challenge by “defining a sequence of cyber defense actions that can be executed for each type of playbook”.\nUsage: This will help entities to: (a) “create course of action playbooks in a structured machine-readable format” (b) “digitally sign course of action playbooks” (c) “securely share course of action playbooks across organisational boundaries and technological solutions” and (d) “document processing instructions for course of action playbooks in a machine-readable format”.",

It also defines a representative system lifecycle model that comprises of the following stages:\nConcept – Development – Production – Utilisation – Support – Retirement.\nNote: Each domain of a system-of-interest should be considered as a separate entity that can have a series of stages through which it goes, forming a life cycle model for that domain. When a system has elements that span multiple domains, every domain’s life cycle model should be thought through individually. Also, all the life cycle models and their stages should be considered holistically and care taken that they work in concert.\nISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1 relationship to detailed process standards is given below.\nISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 focuses on the processes that are applied within a life cycle. The processes can be used by acquirer organisations, suppliers (OEMs, system integrators, service providers) and management to fulfil their responsibilities pertaining to the system of interest. Processes are performed as required to achieve stated objectives within a lifecycle stage.\nOrganisations, when considering a new project, should select a life cycle model and the necessary life cycle processes to satisfy applicable life cycle stage entry or exit criteria. Decisions as to which processes to select should be based on cost-benefit or risk reduction.\nISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 provides a specific example of four groups of system life cycle processes: Agreement, Organisational Project-enabling, Technical Management and Technical. The same is depicted in Figure 2-4, along with sub clause numbers of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 in which the specific purpose, expected outcomes, activities and tasks of the processes are described.\nOrganisational Project-Enabling processes provide enabling resources and infrastructure that are used to create, support, and monitor projects and to assess project effectiveness. Technical Management processes provide requirements so that adequate planning, assessment, and control activities are performed to manage processes and life cycle stages. The role of these two groups of processes is to achieve the project goals within applicable life cycle stages to satisfy an agreement. The Technical Processes are used to perform life cycle related work related to engineering of systems.\nProjects may need to establish relationships with other projects within the organisation, as well as those in other organisations. Such relationships are established through the Agreement processes of acquisition and supply. The degree of formality of the agreement is adapted to the internal or external business relationships between projects.",

    "content": "One of the major challenges of large projects with multiple stakeholders is the documentation to help various stakeholders understand the characteristics, features and design of the system, and to establish a common reference among parties involved in the deployment, operation, maintenance and support of the system. The ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:20221 Architecture Description (AD) international standard helps organisations to express and document architecture descriptions of large and complex systems in a standardised manner.\nEvery complex system has multiple stakeholders across the federated digital ecosystem. Expressing a system’s architecture using AD will help all the stakeholders to understand its evolution, composition, behaviour and maintainability. The AD methodology is useful to specify requirements of various entities, including software, systems, enterprises, systems of systems, families of systems, products (goods or services), product lines, service lines, technologies and business domains. The Architectural Description conceptual foundations2 are summarised below.\nAD Concepts A system is situated in an environment. The environment of a system may contain other systems. The system’s environment is bounded by and understood through the identification and analysis of the system’s stakeholders and their concerns. The environment determines the totality of influences upon the system throughout its life cycle, including its interactions with that environment.\nStakeholders have interests in a system, which are expressed as concerns. Concerns arise throughout the life cycle from system needs and requirements, from design choices and from implementation and operating considerations. A concern could manifest in many forms, such as in relation to one or more stakeholder needs, goals, expectations, responsibilities, requirements, design constraints, assumptions, dependencies, quality attributes, architecture decisions, risks or other issues pertaining to the system.\nArchitecture of a system constitutes what is essential about the system in relation to its environment (in an abstract form). The term system-of-interest is also used to refer to the system whose architecture is under consideration in the preparation of an AD.\nArchitecture descriptions (AD) are used to express architectures for systems of interest (in a documented form). They include one or more Architecture Views that address the concerns of stakeholders. AD may include information not part of any architecture view. Examples include system overview, architecture rationale etc.\nAn Architecture Viewpoint frames one or more concerns and a concern can be framed by more than one viewpoint. Examples of viewpoints are i) business/ mission viewpoint, ii) deployment viewpoint.\nEach Architecture Viewpoint has exactly one Architecture View that expresses the architecture of the system of interest in accordance with the Architecture Viewpoint and addresses the concerns framed by the governing viewpoint. Thus, a viewpoint is a way of looking at systems and a view is a result of applying a viewpoint. Examples of views are i) business/ mission view, ii) deployment view, iii) operations view.\nArchitecture View is composed of one or more Architecture Models. Each architectural model is developed using the conventions and methods established by its associated viewpoint. An architectural model may participate in more than one view. Consistency between the views is maintained using correspondence rules.\nArchitecture decisions pertain to system concerns. Architecture rationale records explanations, justifications and reasoning about architectural decisions. The rationale for a decision may include the basis for the decision, alternatives and trade-offs considered, and potential consequences of the decision.\nExecution views consist of a set of models that describe and document what a software system does at runtime and how it does it. The term runtime refers to the actual time that the software system is functioning during testing or in the ﬁeld.\nArchitecting Architecting is an activity that is performed throughout the system lifecycle within the context of a project and/ or organisation. An architecture description is a work product resulting from the execution of architecting activities within the lifecycle of the system of interest. Annexure C of ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 demonstrates the use of architecting in the context of system and software lifecycle processes defined by ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207 respectively.\nUses of Architectural Descriptions Some of the uses of architecture description methodology by various stakeholders throughout the system life cycle are given below:\nas basis for system design and development activities\nas basis to analyse and evaluate alternative implementations of an architecture\nas development and maintenance documentation\ndocumenting essential aspects of a system, such as:\nintended use and environment\nprinciples, assumptions and constraints to guide future change\npoints of flexibility or limitations of the system with respect to future changes\narchitecture decisions, their rationales and implications\nas input to automated tools for simulation, system generation and analysis\nspecifying a group of systems sharing common features\ncommunicating among parties involved in the development, production, deployment, operation and maintenance of a system\nas basis for preparation of acquisition documents (such as requests for proposal and statements of work)\ncommunicating among clients, acquirers, suppliers and developers as a part of contract negotiations\ndocumenting the characteristics, features and design of a system for potential clients, acquirers, owners, operators and integrators\nplanning for transition from a legacy architecture to a new architecture\nas guide to operational and infrastructure support and configuration management\nas support to system planning, scheduling and budgeting activities\nestablishing criteria for certifying implementations for compliance with an architecture\nas compliance mechanism to external and project and/or organization-internal policies\nas basis for review, analysis, and evaluation of the system across its life cycle\nas basis to analyse and evaluate alternative architectures\nsharing lessons learned and reusing architectural knowledge through viewpoints, patterns and styles\ntraining and education of stakeholders and other parties on best practices in architecting and system evolution.\nExample of Application of AD Concepts Application of the Architectural Description concepts to a sample project is given below.

    "content": "NIST SP 800-160 Vol 1 Systems engineering provides a foundation for a disciplined and structured approach to building assured, trustworthy secure systems. Systems security engineering is a subdiscipline of systems engineering that addresses security-relevant considerations intended to produce secure outcomes.\nIn recent years there is a clear recognition that “Systems security engineering must be fundamental to systems engineering. Security fundamentals must be clearly understood by stakeholders and effectively evaluated in a way that considers broad goals with security functions and outcomes.”1\nNIST SP 800-160 Vol 1r1 (Nov 2022) recognises that “building trustworthy, secure systems cannot occur in a vacuum with stovepipes for software, hardware, information technology, and the human element (e.g., designers, operators, users, attackers of these systems). Rather, it requires a transdisciplinary approach to protection, a determination across all assets where loss could occur, and an understanding of adversity, including how adversaries attack and compromise systems. It addresses security issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements and protection needs and the use of established engineering processes to ensure that such requirements and needs are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor across the entire life cycle of the system.”\nThis publication describes the security design principles, concepts, and techniques that are part of a trustworthy secure design approach. These can be applied in the development of new capabilities or systems, modification of existing capabilities or systems, and development of system of systems. It is intended to be used by:\nSystems engineers, security engineers, and other engineering professionals.\nProfessionals and teams, who perform other system life cycle activities or tasks, such as those listed below\nSecurity governance, risk management, and oversight\nSecurity verification, validation, testing, evaluation, auditing, assessment, inspection, and monitoring\nAcquisition, budgeting, and project management\nOperations, maintenance, sustainment, logistics, and support\nProviders of technology-related products, systems, or services\nThe core objective of the publication is to be engineering-based, not operations- or technology-based. Organisations can adapt the concepts and principles for trustworthy secure design, the systems life cycle processes and security-relevant activities and tasks described in the publication to achieve consistent security outcomes in the capabilities delivered by their systems.\nSystem Security Viewpoints\nThe publication defines three predominant viewpoints of system security, viz i) system function, ii) security function, and iii) life cycle assets.\nSystem function is the system’s purpose or role as fulfilled by the totality of the capability it delivers combined with its intended use. Every system is required to satisfy all the stakeholder capability needs.\nSecurity function is the system’s fulfilment of the stakeholder’s protection capability needs.\nLife cycle assets are associated with the system but are not engineered into or delivered with the system. Life cycle assets typically include intellectual property, data and information associated with the system, and supporting assets for development, production and sustenance of the system. The association of lifecycle assets with the system means that they can be the direct cause of loss or a conduit/means through which a loss can occur.\nThe system function is the predominant viewpoint and establishes the context for the security function and the associated system life cycle assets.\nSystems Security Engineering Framework\nThe systems security engineering framework provides a conceptual view of the key contexts within which systems security engineering activities are conducted. It defines three contexts for conducting activities and tasks:\nThe problem context to help ensure that the engineering is driven by a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem.\nThe solution context to drive the effort to provide the solution, supported by a set of activities to design and realize the solution.\nThe trustworthiness context is a decision-making context that provides an evidence-based demonstration – through reasoning – that the system of interest is deemed trustworthy (or not) based on a set of claims derived from security objectives.\nNIST SP 800-160 Vol 2 Cyber resiliency for systems that include or depend on cyber resources is a part of operational resilience but needs specific guidance due to its distinctive characteristics. The publication provides guidance on how to apply cyber resiliency concepts, constructs, and engineering practices to systems security engineering and risk management. It is to be used by systems security engineering and other professionals, who are responsible for activities and tasks related to system life cycle and risk management processes within and external to the organisation.\nWhile much of the cyber resiliency analysis in the publication uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT\u0026CK™) framework, organisations are not constrained to use only the MITRE ATT\u0026CK framework but can use other frameworks too.\nUseful concepts from the publication are described below. Readers are advised to consult the publication for detailed information and guidance on cyber resiliency.\nCyber-resilient systems are systems that have security measures or safeguards “built in” as a foundational part of the architecture and design and that display a high level of resiliency to withstand cyber-attacks, faults, and failures and continue to operate in a degraded or debilitated state to carry out the mission-essential functions of the organisation.\nCyber resiliency engineering practices are the methods, processes, modelling, and analytical techniques used to identify and analyse proposed solutions. These practices are applied in system life cycle processes so that the resultant cyber resiliency solutions are aligned with the stakeholder requirements and protection needs.\nCyber resiliency engineering framework provides constructs that include cyber resiliency goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, and design principles. While these constructs are applied at the system level in the publication, they can also be applied beyond the system level to mission and business function level, organisational level and sector level. The framework is based on Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework developed by the MITRE Corporation2,3.\nCyber resiliency goals and objectives provide a vocabulary for describing what properties and capabilities are needed. Cyber resiliency techniques, approaches, and design principles provide a vocabulary for discussing how a system can achieve its cyber resiliency goals and objectives.\nFour cyber resiliency goals, namely Anticipate, Withstand, Recover and Adapt, eight cyber resiliency objectives and 14 cyber resiliency techniques are part of the cyber resiliency engineering framework.\nCyber resiliency solutions are relevant only if they have some effect on risk. Hence their primary focus is to reduce the risk by reducing the three core factors\nthe likelihood of occurrence of threat events, the ability of threat events to cause harm, i.e., the likelihood of impact, the extent of harm from threat events, i.e., the level of impact. The publication describes three models, namely the risk model, threat model and consequence (impact) model for cyber resiliency. It further identifies controls from NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 that directly support cyber resiliency. The principle applied for associating controls with cyber resiliency is that “cyber resiliency is about ensuring continued mission operations despite the fact that an adversary has established a foothold in the organisation’s systems and cyber infrastructure”. It also provides guidance on adversary-oriented analysis for achieving cyber resiliency, specifically the perspective of protecting systems against adversarial threats using MITRE ATT\u0026CK™ for Enterprise4 and ATT\u0026CK™ for Industrial Control Systems (ICS)5 frameworks. Supporting perspectives are separately available as MITRE Defend6 and MITRE Engage7 frameworks.\nSecurity in the Future of Systems Engineering (FuSE), a Roadmap of Foundational Concepts, INCOSE International Symposium, July 2021. ↩︎\nhttps://www.mitre.org/news-insights/publication/cyber-resiliency-engineering-framework ↩︎\nhttps://www.mitre.org/news-insights/publication/cyber-resiliency-engineering-aid-updated-cyber-resiliency-engineering ↩︎\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/ ↩︎\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/ ↩︎\nhttps://d3fend.mitre.org/ ↩︎\nhttps://engage.mitre.org/ ↩︎",

    "content": "Organisational Structure Workforce responsible for IT, OT, IIoT and Information Security within organisations can be generically divided into four levels of hierarchy, as given below. Typical job titles at each level are also mentioned, which are indicative of the associated job roles, tasks, and responsibilities.\nGoverning board and top management level – Board of Directors, MD, CEO.\nSenior management level – Vice Presidents, CFO, CRO, CHRO, CTO, CIO, CISO, CSO, Heads of Business Units, Divisions, and Departments.\nMiddle and lower management level – IT Project Managers, Technology Managers, IT Operations Managers, IT Security Managers, Cyber Defence, NOC, and SOC Team Leads, GRC Managers, Workforce Development Managers etc.\nIndividual Contributor level – Operators, Analysts, Administrators, Specialists, Engineers, Technicians, Architects, Developers, Testers, QA, Apprentices, Associates, Interns. Individual contributors may also include MSP/ MSSP personnel and contractors etc, working in the CSEs.\nThe middle and lower management, as well as individual contributors, are accountable and responsible for day-to-day operational activities and tasks.\nWorkforce Competencies The overall workforce in an organisation, having accountability and responsibility for cybersecurity, would typically comprise of a composite mix of employees, contracted/ hired resources, and external providers of products (OEMs/ ISVs) and services (OEM partners, System Integrators, consultants, other service providers). The essential competencies and focus of the composite workforce are summarised in the table below, along with the applicable knowledge, skills, expertise, and experience.\nWorkforce Level Focus Competencies Knowledge \u0026 Skill Areas Governing board and top management Business objectives, Information/ Cybersecurity Business strategy, governance of use of IT, OT and Information security. Expertise in managing technology for a qualified IT Strategy Committee (ITSC), where established Business Strategy, Risk, Finance, Technology, Workforce Development. The board should have independent Director with substantial IT expertise in managing/guiding information technology initiatives. Senior management Security programme, GRC Business and technology leadership and experience Governance, Risk, Compliance, Technology, Operations, Security Middle and lower management Technology management Business and technology management experience Technology, Operations, Security, Compliance, Supply Chain, Programme Management, MSP/ MSSP management Individual Contributor Technology Technical skills, expertise, and experience Systems, networks, platforms, applications, databases, enterprise IT and IS functions, cloud platforms and services, ITSM, ISMS, network and security operations, cyber defence, risk analysis, forensics, data analytics, systems \u0026 security design \u0026 engineering, software development, CI/CD, DevSecOps, testing, VAPT, audit Ownership of Activities and Tasks All operating processes within organisations are owned and carried out by designated teams, each having middle and lower-level managers overseeing the operations on a day-to-day and periodic basis.\nTypically, the team compositions include different individuals with specialized skills and knowledge. Given the size and complexity of IT, OT, IIoT and cybersecurity ecosystems, the CSEs and other organisations usually have a composite workforce which is a mix of own employees, contracted workforce, resources of SIs, OEMs, ISVs, Partners, consultants, MSPs, SaaS and other service providers, who work together to carry out the organisations’ activities and tasks. A must have practice for an outsourced workforce is to have senior and middle-level managers of the organisation oversee the outsourced work.\nCybersecurity practices and processes can map across multiple cybersecurity support functions due to the interconnected nature of cybersecurity operations, where different aspects of a process may support various functions simultaneously. Considering the interconnected nature of cybersecurity activities, entities should assign the primary ownership and support roles to the activities related to each practice/ process.\nPrimary ownership indicates the team or role with overall responsibility for executing a particular cybersecurity process or function. The primary team or role is accountable for the required outcomes and decision-making. The support (collaborative() role identifies the supporting teams or roles that contribute to the overall objectives of the practice or process. They may be required to provide necessary data, analysis, or assistance to ensure the process’s success.\nThe top and senior management of CSEs may use well-known mechanisms like RACI matrix to outline the roles and responsibilities of individuals and teams. The primary owners must be clear about their responsibility and accountability while the collaborative teams and roles must know what support is expected from them.\nIt is essential that the top and senior management clearly communicate the overarching objectives of cybersecurity and how each team’s efforts contribute to them. Cyber resilience can be enhanced when there is a shared sense of purpose and reduced friction between teams that usually arises due to overlapping or conflicting purposes.\nOrganisations will accrue significant benefits if their workforce understands the end goal of the practices and processes, and how the activities and tasks help or harm the accomplishment of the goal. Training and enablement of the workforce should focus on this aspect so that the workforce has a clear understanding of their ownership and responsibility for achieving the objectives.",
