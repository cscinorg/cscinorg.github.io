    "content": "The interconnected and digitalised world requires a constant alignment of an enterprise’s mission, objectives, and functions with the larger context of the national, regional, and sectoral ecosystem in which the enterprise or organisation operates. The external context of an entity includes the customers/ users of an entity’s services, as well as the suppliers, auditors and supporting agencies. In the case of regulated entities and CSEs, the national bodies, viz. the government, regulators, nodal agencies, and other authorities, are important stakeholders/ interested parties, having legal, regulatory, oversight and advisory responsibilities over the entities.\nThe Ecosystem In modern business, it is very rare that an entity operates in isolation. Besides the customers and users and national bodies, the regulated and critical sector entities provide or use the services of other external entities in a cooperative, coordinated, or federated manner. In addition, the entities also connect with their suppliers and service providers by means of various “channels” and operate using a variety of federated business processes. This business ecosystem is termed in this documentation as functional business ecosystem of an entity.\nThe business ecosystem of an entity can also be described in terms of the use of IT in the provisioning and consumption of business services, the underlying business processes and information flows between the entity and its users, customers, partners, service providers and national bodies. This technology ecosystem is widely applicable in today’s digital environment and is termed in this documentation as federated digital ecosystem of an entity.\nBusiness and Digital Ecosystems The business and digital ecosystems of an entity in the Indian context is pictorally shown below:\nEach organisation in the federated ecosystem is responsible for its own IT and information security. The organisations however must be aware and responsive to the information security needs of other participating entities within the federated ecosystem, and comply with directions, guidelines and standards prescribed by law, regulation, and mandates of nodal agencies. Every organisation in the complex, federated ecosystem is ultimately responsible for carrying out due diligence, not only about its own information security but also with respect to all parties in its external context.\nThe National Cyberspace A pictoral view of the national cyberspace is shown below:\nThe pictorial above describes the digital ecosystem elements (blobs) of the national cyberspace from an ownership perspective (who uses, owns, provides, manages and controls what). Usage, ownership, management and control of elements of the digital ecosystem are important criteria to assess the trustworthiness and risk associated with the elements, specifically from the perspective of external threats.\nEntities are encouraged to print out a blank diagram and populate it with their own information infrastructure components (web portals, email system, ERP, CRM, OEM subscriptions \u0026 support etc). It will give them a high level perspective of their digital landscape.\nSmart, Resilient and Sustainable The business and digital ecosystems of critical sector entities are highly complex and fast evolving. Generally, the top leadership of entities have a good grasp and understanding of the business complexities and are able to handle them well. However, the complexities of the digital ecosystem are not well understood by the top leadership and it is left to the CIOs, CISOs and their teams to handle the same. In most cases the technical and project teams adopt a technology-driven approach, which leads to misalignment between the business needs and the use of technology provided by the underlying digital ecosystem.\nThe integration of IT at the sectoral, regional, and national levels will only increase in future. Hence, at the national level, there is need to develop capabilities for a smart, resilient, and sustainable digital ecosystem. These terms are described below:\n‘Smart’ describes the high levels of automation, analytics and decision support capabilities that are enabled by the use of IT.\n‘Resilient’ describes the ability of the IT ecosystem to not only withstand large scale attacks and mitigate its destructive power but also the capability to recover from a successful attack in the shortest possible time with minimal damage or disruption.\n‘Sustainable’ describes the ability of the critical sector entities and the nation as a whole to be able to use IT for delivery of national critical functions and business services efficiently and effectively over a long period of time that extends into decades.\nIn general, smart capabilities are achieved through the use of intelligent devices, analytics, AI, and machine learning, which can significantly improve the functioning, performance and resilience of the digital ecosystem. Automation agents and bots provide an infinitely scalable non-human workforce that can complement the limited human workforce. Resilience is a key component of business and organisational needs and achieved through well-designed operating procedures, processes, and practices. Sustainability is achieved through a combination of institutional structures, people, policies, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) mechanisms.\nStrategic Program Approach Resilience and sustainability of IT and Information Security are strategic goals of organisations. Hence, they must be driven by the top leadership and management, who must take a long-term strategic view of both the use of IT to achieve business objectives and use of Information and Cyber Security to protect IT and business. Governing bodies and top leadership should assess whether they have adequate in-house capabilities to strategise on these two goals or they require external expertise to support their leaders and teams.\nA smart, resilient, and sustainable federated digital ecosystem is best achieved through a strategic program approach that regularly addresses all issues related to the following:\nProtect information and information infrastructure in cyberspace. Minimise vulnerabilities and risks through proactive actions. Build capabilities to prevent and rapidly respond to cyber incidents. Minimise damage and ensure fast recovery from cyber-attacks.",

    "content": "Purpose The purpose of this site is to inform and guide the leadership, management and workforce of critical sector entities (CSEs) on various aspects related to the use, security and resilience of their digital ecosystem. The content provides a practitioner’s perspective that is also useful to entities of other sectors too.\nBackground Over the last two decades, India has transformed itself into a highly digitalised nation that has embraced Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) deeply into almost all aspects of our lives. We now have a vibrant national cyberspace, which manifests through a digital ecosystem formed by geographically dispersed, interconnected and federated conglomeration of systems, networks, data repositories, applications, devices, processes and services.\nThe cyberspace is vital to national security, economy, public health, public safety and overall national well-being. The digital ecosystem enables critical sector entities and other organisations to deliver the national critical functions through business and industrial processes that use the digital infrastructure. Hence, it is essential to build, maintain and continually improve the resilience of the digital ecosystem of our critical sectors in a coordinated manner. Any loss of trust in the same has severe consequences for users and other stakeholders of the national cyberspace.\nThe critical sectors in India are listed below:\nBanking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) Telecom Government Power and Energy (P\u0026E) Transport Strategic and Public Enterprises (S\u0026PE) Health Defence Examples of critical functions delivered through the cyberspace in India are listed below:\nBanking, financial markets and insurance payments, transactions, clearing and settlement. Voice and data connectivity and internet services. E-Governance and citizen services. Control, operation and management of utility services like power, fuel, gas, smart cities etc. Control, operation and management of transportation services like railway/ metro, air traffic, ports etc. Services related to defence, internal security, public safety, and law enforcement. Public health related services. The IT Act 2000 (amended 2008) applies to users and providers of the digital ecosystem, including home users, MSMEs, large enterprises, government \u0026 non-government entities. It was framed to help secure the digital ecosystem while in use by the government, businesses and others for their service delivery, business and organisational functions.\nThe IT Act recognises that the basic responsibility for protecting an entity’s information infrastructure lies with the entity itself. It envisages the possible threats to the digital ecosystem during its use and provides direction and guidance for its protection. Relevant Rules have been framed under the IT Act to enable designated cybersecurity agencies like NCIIPC and CERT-In to oversee, monitor and respond to cyber attacks from malicious threat actors onto the critical information infrastructure (CII) and the national digital ecosystem. There are other Acts and Rules that mandate sector regulators and other authorities to provide regulatory frameworks to secure the critical sectors and build cyber resilience in critical sector entities under their jurisdiction.\nSecuring the national cyberspace is a collective effort. The public and private entities that own, run, and manage their information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of the same. The intent of the Government is to ensure that adequate checks and balances are implemented, through appropriate legislations, policies and guidelines, for secure and resilient operations of the critical functions and their underlying critical information infrastructure. The intent of national nodal agencies and sectoral regulators is to ensure that cyber risk is appropriately managed in the sectors, to the level demanded by the national interest.\nStructure The site’s documentation section is divided into multiple chapters and topics that reflect the perspectives, concerns and needs of different stakeholders within and across critical sector entities and other organisations.\nThe Notes, FAQs, Resources and Glossary sections will be populated over time. A Discussions platform is also set up through GitHub for feedback and community engagement.\nContext Cyber-attacks on critical information infrastructure by organised criminal groups, non-state and state sponsored groups can cause debilitating impact to national security, economy, public health and public safety. The critical sector entities that own, run, and manage their critical information infrastructure are responsible for the protection of their computer resources (systems, networks, applications, data repositories and identities). The entities are expected and required to use appropriate technology, implement various best practices and build a competent workforce to achieve a high level of cyber resilience.\nThe CSEs and other organisations have no dearth of information and guidance from multiple sources to help them secure their IT systems and networks. Yet, a large number of them continue to suffer downtime and losses due to cyber-attacks. An analysis of successful attacks indicate that most of them succeeded because the entities did not or could not apply the cybersecurity information and guidance effectively. A common refrain from cybersecurity experts and empanelled auditors is that a large number of entities have negligible or poor implementation of basic and essential cybersecurity controls. It looks as if the entities “do not understand” or “do not want to implement” cybersecurity.\nInteraction with business leaders, managers and the non-IT workforce of entities provides a different perspective. The underlying message from these interactions is that they are unable to integrate cybersecurity into their way of thinking and working – organisational hierarchy, business impact analysis, roles and responsibilities, practices and processes, management systems, reporting structures, RACI etc. Cybersecurity is seen as a technical function that is best carried out by technology experts.\nEvery organisation has a complex mix of internal and external workforce and other stakeholders, each having their own specific roles, functions, backgrounds, competence and limitations. However, everyone understands the concept of business resilience and can therefore grasp the concept of cyber resilience. Hence, it would be appropriate to convert cybersecurity discussions into cyber resilience discussions, to enable the participation of all stakeholders. This calls for\nA common vocabulary that business and technical stakeholders can both use to clearly communicate their respective perspectives, both orally and in writing, without ambiguity and misunderstanding, A shared understanding leads to faster and better convergence of perspectives and improving the decision process at all levels. A cyber resilience framework that harmonises business, IT and cybersecurity perspectives, as also government and regulatory guidelines, directives and global best practices. This site attempts to address the two aspects mentioned above. A common vocabulary is provided through a glossary of terms and definitions that both business and technical users can understand and use. The chapters and topics address various aspects of cyber resilience framework, covering institutional structures, people, policies, procedures, practices and processes, technology and collaboration.\nMany of the insights and perspectives are derived from the practices and processes adopted by organisations having a high level of cybersecurity capability and maturity. Organisations should take this documentation as a generic framework that is further adapted for their specific requirements.\nNote Pictorial representations in the documents are indicative and should be used for triggering discussions on different perspectives.\nContact For queries, suggestions and feedback, please contact the site administrator at admin@cscin.org.in.",

    "content": "The glossary of terms and definitions listed below may be used by stakeholders to communicate their perspectives for common understanding. The terms and definitions are derived from various standards, applicable laws (e.g. The IT Act 2000), regulations and public sources. The source(s) of definitions of the terms are also provided, where available.\nBasic Terms Information Security (NIST CRSC) the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Information Security (ISO 27000:2018) preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Note: In addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.\nCyber Security (ITAA-2008) protecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Note 1: The terms Information Security (IS) and Cyber Security (CS) are often used interchangeably, since there are only some minor distinctions between the two terms. Notes 2 to 5 below provide guidance for specific situations in which one term is more appropriate than the other.\nNote 2: In general, the information security is used in the context of securing information that is held and managed in both digital and non-digital (paper-based) forms. Cybersecurity is used in the context of securing the cyber-ecosystem (IT, OT, and IIoT) from cyber-attacks.\nNote 3: Data and information content encompasses i) content created, used and managed using office productivity tools, ii) content stored in databases and other electronic repositories, which may be located on-premises or on cloud, iii) content searched, accessed and shared using web, email and other technologies, iv) machine to machine exchange of content through information exchange standards and protocols (EDI, API, STIX/TAXII), and OT-specific communication protocols (Modbus, DNP3/ IEEE 1815-2012, IEC-60870, IEC 61850, IEC 61131, IEC 62351) and, v) archival content stored in online and offline backups.\nNote 4: Data and information related activities encompass i) content creation, updation and deletion (CRUD activities), ii) data processing, iii) view, copy, scan, search and print, iv) content integrity and confidentiality protection using digital signatures and encryption, v) masking or redaction of sensitive content and reclassification of the masked/ redacted content, vi) content exchange and distribution through electronic media and communication channels, vii) short-term and long-term storage of content and, viii) secure disposal of content from all the electronic stores, as per the organisation policies.\nNote 5: Most OT systems are process control systems. Typically, the input and output OT data of such systems have a short period of utility. Hence, confidentiality of such data exchanged through OT protocols, as well as intermittent data loss are minor concerns. As regards data integrity, the concern is more about the integrity of the process control systems that generate, consume and process the data using OT protocols. The most important concerns of such systems are the availability of the systems themselves, safety of the physical environment around the systems or influenced by them. In summary, focus of OT security is more about protecting critical processes (Safety, Availability, Integrity) and less about data loss (Confidentiality).\nCyber resiliency (NIST CRSC) the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment. Note: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting the digital infrastructure from unauthorised access, data breaches, and cyber-attacks. Cyber resilience is an organisation’s capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber threats and disruptions. Both functions require a combination of technologies, practices and processes, policies and controls, peope and governance for delivering the required outcomes.\nGovernance of Enterprise IT and Information Security Adopted from ISO/IEC Standards Accountable (ISO 38500:2015) answerable for actions, decisions and performance. Accountability (ISO 38500:2015) state of being accountable. Accountability relates to an allocated responsibility. The responsibility can be based on regulation or agreement or through assignment as part of delegation. Context of the organisation (ISO 9000:2015) Combination of internal and external issues that can have an effect on an organisation’s approach to developing and achieving its objectives. Direct (ISO 38500:2015) communicate desired purposes and outcomes to. In the context of governance of IT, ‘direct’ involves setting objectives, strategies, and policies to be adopted by the members of the organisation to ensure that use of IT meets business objectives. Objectives, strategies, and policies can be set by managers if they have authority delegated by the governing body. Entity (ISO 27014:2020) a corporate or enterprise group of companies or a single company in the public or private sector, a government body or a body owned or controlled by the government. An entity can have multiple Organizations within itself or be identical to the organisation, as in smaller companies. The entity has governance authority over the organisation. Evaluate (ISO 38500:2015) consider and make informed judgements. In the context of governance of IT, evaluate involves judgements about the internal and external, current and future circumstances and opportunities relating to the organisation’s current and future use of IT. Executive manager (ISO 38500:2015) person who has authority delegated from the governing body for implementation of strategies and policies to fulfil the purpose of the organisation. Executive managers can include roles which report to the governing body or the head of the organisation or have overall accountability for major reporting function, for example Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), Heads of Government Organizations, Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), Chief Operating Officers (COOs), Chief Information Officers (CIs), and similar roles. In management standards, executive managers can be referred to as top management. Governance (ISO 38500:2015) system of directing and controlling Governance of IT (ISO 38500:2015) system by which the current and future use of IT is directed and controlled. Governance of IT is a component or a subset of organisational governance. The term governance of IT is equivalent to corporate governance of IT, enterprise governance of IT, and organisational governance of IT. Note: Typically, Enterprise IT Governance deals with resources required to acquire, process, store and disseminate information. Enterprise Information Security Governance deals with assurance of information confidentiality, integrity and availability and effective communication of the same with various external stakeholders.\nGoverning body (ISO 27014:2020) person or group of people who are accountable for the performance and conformance of the entity. Management (ISO 38500:2015) exercise of control and supervision within the authority and accountability established by governance. Note: The term management describes the coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation (ISO 9000:2015). It can include establishing policies and objectives, and processes to achieve the objectives. It is also used as a collective term for those with responsibility for controlling an organisation or parts of an organisation. The term managers is used to avoid confusion with management systems.\nManagers (ISO 38500:2015) group of people responsible for control and supervision of an organisation or parts of an organisation. Executive managers are a category of managers. Monitor (ISO 38500:2015) review as a basis for appropriate decisions and adjustments. Monitoring involves routinely obtaining information about progress against plans as well as the periodic examination of overall achievements against agreed strategies and outcomes to provide a basis for decision making and adjustments to plans. Monitoring includes reviewing compliance with relevant legislation, regulations, and organisational policies. Organisation (ISO 27014:2020) The whole entity or part of an entity, which works under the governance authority of the entity. Note: ISO/IEC 27014:2020 provides the distinction between entity and organisation in the context of ISMS. By definition, the ISMS covers the whole of an organisation, which by itself may cover the whole of the entity or part of the entity. Typically the two terms defined in ISO 27014:2020 are applied to both the governance of IT and Information Security.\nOrganisational governance (ISO 38500:2015) system by which Organisations are directed and controlled. Responsibility (ISO 38500:2015) obligation to act and take decisions to achieve required outcomes Top management (ISO 27014:2020) person or group of people who direct and control the organisation (as defined above) at the highest level. The top management of the organisation is accountable to the governing body of the entity and has the power to delegate authority and provide resources within the organisation. In smaller entities, where the entity and organisation are identical, top management is the same as governing body. Use of IT (ISO 38500:2015) planning, design, development, deployment, operation, management, and application of IT to fulfil business objectives and create value for the organisation. The use of IT includes the demand for, and the supply of, IT, the current and future use of IT. Customer (ISO 20000-10:2018) organisation or part of an organisation that receives a service or services. EXAMPLE: Consumer, client, beneficiary, sponsor, purchaser.\nNote 1: A customer can be internal or external to the organisation delivering the service or services.\nNote 2: A customer can also be a user. A customer can also act as a supplier.\nExternal supplier (ISO 20000-10:2018) another party that is external to the organisation that enters into a contract to contribute to the planning, design, transition, delivery or improvement of a service, service component or process. Interested party, Stakeholder (ISO 9000:2015) person or organisation that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision or activity. Internal Supplier (ISO 20000-10:2018) part of a larger organisation that is outside the scope of the SMS, that enters into a documented agreement to contribute to the planning, design, transition, delivery or improvement of a service, service component or process. EXAMPLE - procurement, infrastructure, finance, human resources, facilities.\nService provider (ISO 20000-10:2018) organisation that manages and delivers a service or services to customers. Service integrator (ISO 20000-10:2018) entity that manages the integration of services and service components delivered by multiple suppliers Note: The role of the service integrator supports the promotion of end-to-end service management, particularly in complex supply chains by ensuring all parties are aware of, enabled to perform, and are held accountable for their role in the supply chain.\nUser (ISO 20000-10:2018) individual or group that interacts with or benefits from a service or services. Note: Examples of users include a person or community of people. A customer can also be a user.\nEffectiveness (ISO 9000:2015, ISO 20000-10:2018) extent to which planned activities are realized and planned results are achieved. Efficiency (ISO 9000:2015) relationship between the result achieved and the resources used. Mission (ISO 9000:2015) organisation’s purpose for existing as expressed by top management. Objective (ISO 9000:2015) result to be achieved. An objective can relate to different disciplines, be strategic, tactical, or operational, and can apply at different levels (such as strategic, organisation-wide, project, product and process. An objective can be expressed in other ways, e.g. as an intended outcome, a purpose, an operational criterion, or by other words with similar meaning (e.g. aim, goal, or target). Note: Objectives are usually defined using SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time bound - statements of purpose.\nPolicy (ISO 38500:2015) intentions and direction of an organisation as formally expressed by its governing body or executive managers acting with appropriate authority. Process (ISO 9000:2015) set of interrelated or interacting activities that use inputs to deliver an intended result. Procedure (ISO 9000:2015) specified way to carry out an activity or a process, which may or may not be documented. Strategy (ISO 9000:2015) plan to achieve a long-term or overall objective. Vision (ISO 9000:2015) aspiration of what an organisation would like to become as expressed by top management. Adopted from ITAA-2008 Computer Resource (ITAA-2008) computer, communication device, computer system, computer network, data, computer database or software. Note: The term ‘Resource’ is also used, when there is no ambiguity that it refers to computer resource.\nComputer (ITAA-2008) any electronic, magnetic, optical or other high-speed data processing device or system which performs logical, arithmetic, and memory functions by manipulations of electronic, magnetic or optical impulses, and includes all input, output, processing, storage, computer software, or communication facilities which are connected or related to the computer in a computer system or computer network.
